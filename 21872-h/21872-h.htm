<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[Pg&nbsp;1]</a></span>

<p>Perhaps the most striking characteristic
of the life of David is its romantic variety
of circumstances. What a many-coloured career
that was which began amidst the pastoral solitudes
of Bethlehem, and ended in the chamber
where the dying ears heard the blare of the
trumpets that announced the accession of Bathsheba's
son! He passes through the most sharply
contrasted conditions, and from each gathers
some fresh fitness for his great work of giving
voice and form to all the phases of devout feeling.
The early shepherd life deeply influenced
his character, and has left its traces on many a
line of his psalms.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"Love had he found in huts where poor men lie;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">His daily teachers had been woods and rills;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">The silence that is in the starry sky,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">The sleep that is among the lonely hills."</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg&nbsp;2]</a></span></p>

<p>And then, in strange contrast with the meditative
quiet and lowly duties of these first years,
came the crowded vicissitudes of the tempestuous
course through which he reached his throne&mdash;court
minstrel, companion and friend of a
king, idol of the people, champion of the armies
of God&mdash;and in his sudden elevation keeping the
gracious sweetness of his lowlier, and perhaps
happier days. The scene changes with startling
suddenness to the desert. He is "hunted like
a partridge upon the mountains," a fugitive and
half a freebooter, taking service at foreign courts,
and lurking on the frontiers with a band of outlaws
recruited from the "dangerous classes" of
Israel. Like Dante and many more, he has to
learn the weariness of the exile's lot&mdash;how hard
his fare, how homeless his heart, how cold the
courtesies of aliens, how unslumbering the suspicions
which watch the refugee who fights on
the side of his "natural enemies." One more
swift transition and he is on the throne, for long
years victorious, prosperous, and beloved.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"Nor did he change; but kept in lofty place</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">The wisdom which adversity had bred,"</span></p>

<p>till suddenly he is plunged into the mire, and
falsifies all his past, and ruins for ever, by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg&nbsp;3]</a></span>
sin of his mature age, his peace of heart and
the prosperity of his kingdom. Thenceforward
trouble is never far away; and his later years
are shaded with the saddening consciousness of
his great fault, as well as by hatred and rebellion
and murder in his family, and discontent
and alienation in his kingdom.</p>

<p>None of the great men of Scripture pass
through a course of so many changes; none of
them touched human life at so many points;
none of them were so tempered and polished by
swift alternation of heat and cold, by such heavy
blows and the friction of such rapid revolutions.
Like his great Son and Lord, though in a lower
sense, he, too, must be "in all points tempted
like as we are," that his words may be fitted for
the solace and strength of the whole world.
Poets "learn in suffering what they teach in
song." These quick transitions of fortune, and
this wide experience, are the many-coloured
threads from which the rich web of his psalms
is woven.</p>

<p>And while the life is singularly varied, the
character is also singularly full and versatile.
In this respect, too, he is most unlike the other
leading figures of Old Testament history. Con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>trast
him, for example, with the stern majesty
of Moses, austere and simple as the tables of
stone; or with the unvarying tone in the gaunt
strength of Elijah. These and the other mighty
men in Israel are like the ruder instruments of
music&mdash;the trumpet of Sinai, with its one prolonged
note. David is like his own harp of many
chords, through which the breath of God murmured,
drawing forth wailing and rejoicing, the
clear ring of triumphant trust, the low plaint of
penitence, the blended harmonies of all devout
emotions.</p>

<p>The man had his faults&mdash;grave enough. Let
it be remembered that no one has judged them
more rigorously than himself. The critics who
have delighted to point at them have been anticipated
by the penitent; and their indictment
has been little more than the quotation of his
own confession. His tremulously susceptible
nature, especially assailable by the delights of
sense, led him astray. There are traces in his
life of occasional craft and untruthfulness which
even the exigencies of exile and war do not
wholly palliate. Flashes of fierce vengeance at
times break from the clear sky of his generous
nature. His strong affection became, in at least<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
one case, weak and foolish fondness for an unworthy
son.</p>

<p>But when all this is admitted, there remains a
wonderfully rich, lovable character. He is the
very ideal of a minstrel hero, such as the legends
of the East especially love to paint. The shepherd's
staff or sling, the sword, the sceptre, and
the lyre are equally familiar to his hands.
That union of the soldier and the poet gives the
life a peculiar charm, and is very strikingly
brought out in that chapter of the book of
Samuel (2 Sam. xxiii.) which begins, "These be
the last words of David," and after giving the
swan-song of him whom it calls "the sweet
psalmist of Israel," passes immediately to the
other side of the dual character, with, "These
be the names of the mighty men whom David
had."</p>

<p>Thus, on the one side, we see the true poetic
temperament, with all its capacities for keenest
delight and sharpest agony, with its tremulous
mobility, its openness to every impression, its
gaze of child-like wonder, and eager welcome to
whatsoever things are lovely, its simplicity and
self-forgetfulness, its yearnings "after worlds
half realized," its hunger for love, its pity, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
its tears. He was made to be the inspired poet
of the religious affections.</p>

<p>And, on the other side, we see the greatest
qualities of a military leader of the antique type,
in which personal daring and a strong arm
count for more than strategic skill. He dashes
at Goliath with an enthusiasm of youthful courage
and faith. While still in the earliest bloom
of his manhood, at the head of his wild band of
outlaws, he shows himself sagacious, full of resource,
prudent in counsel, and swift as lightning
in act; frank and generous, bold and gentle,
cheery in defeat, calm in peril, patient in privations
and ready to share them with his men,
modest and self-restrained in victory, chivalrous
to his foes, ever watchful, ever hopeful&mdash;a born
leader and king of men.</p>

<p>The basis of all was a profound, joyous trust
in his Shepherd God, an ardour of personal love
to Him, such as had never before been expressed,
if it had ever found place, in Israel.
That trust "opened his mouth to show forth"
God's praise, and strengthened his "fingers to
fight." He has told us himself what was his
habitual temper, and how it was sustained: "I
have set the Lord always before me. Because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth."
(Psa. xvi. 8, 9.)</p>

<p>Thus endowed, he moved among men with
that irresistible fascination which only the greatest
exercise. From the day when he stole like
a sunbeam into the darkened chamber where
Saul wrestled with the evil spirit, he bows all
hearts that come under his spell. The women
of Israel chant his name with song and timbrel,
the daughter of Saul confesses her love unasked,
the noble soul of Jonathan cleaves to him, the
rude outlaws in his little army peril their lives to
gratify his longing for a draught from the well
where he had watered his father's flocks; the
priests let him take the consecrated bread, and
trust him with Goliath's sword, from behind the
altar; his lofty courtesy wins the heart of Abigail;
the very king of the Philistines tells him that he
is "good in his sight as an angel of God;" the
unhappy Saul's last word to him is a blessing;
six hundred men of Gath forsake home and
country to follow his fortunes when he returns
from exile; and even in the dark close of his
reign, though sin and self-indulgence, and neglect
of his kingly duties, had weakened his subjects'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
loyalty, his flight before Absalom is brightened
by instances of passionate devotion which no
common character could have evoked; and even
then his people are ready to die for him, and in
their affectionate pride call him "the light of
Israel." It was a prophetic instinct which
made Jesse call his youngest boy by a name
apparently before unused&mdash;David, "Beloved."</p>

<p>The Spirit of God, acting through these great
natural gifts, and using this diversified experience
of life, originated in him a new form of
inspiration. The Law was the revelation of the
mind, and, in some measure, of the heart, of God
to man. The Psalm is the echo of the law, the
return current set in motion by the outflow of
the Divine will, the response of the heart of man
to the manifested God. There had, indeed,
been traces of hymns before David. There
were the burst of triumph which the daughters
of Israel sang, with timbrel and dance, over
Pharaoh and his host; the prayer of Moses the
man of God (Psa. xc.), so archaic in its tone,
bearing in every line the impress of the weary
wilderness and the law of death; the song of
the dying lawgiver (Deut. xxxii.); the passionate
p&aelig;an of Deborah; and some few briefer frag<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>ments.
But, practically, the Psalm began with
David; and though many hands struck the harp
after him, even down at least to the return from
exile, he remains emphatically "the sweet psalmist
of Israel."</p>

<p>The psalms which are attributed to him have,
on the whole, a marked similarity of manner.
Their characteristics have been well summed up
as "creative originality, predominantly elegiac
tone, graceful form and movement, antique but
lucid style;"<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> to which may be added the intensity
of their devotion, the passion of Divine
love that glows in them all. They correspond,
too, with the circumstances of his life as given
in the historical books. The early shepherd
days, the manifold sorrows, the hunted wanderings,
the royal authority, the wars, the triumphs,
the sin, the remorse, which are woven together
so strikingly in the latter, all reappear in the
psalms. The illusions, indeed, are for the most
part general rather than special, as is natural.
His words are thereby the better fitted for ready
application to the trials of other lives. But it
has been perhaps too hastily assumed that the
allusions are so general as to make it impossible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
to connect them with any precise events, or to
make the psalms and the history mutually
illustrative. Much, no doubt, must be conjectured
rather than affirmed, and much must
be left undetermined; but when all deductions
on that score have been made, it still appears
possible to carry the process sufficiently far to
gain fresh insight into the force and definiteness
of many of David's words, and to use them with
tolerable confidence as throwing light upon the
narrative of his career. The attempt is made in
some degree in this volume.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Delitzsch, Kommentar. u. d. Psalter II. 376.</p></div>

<p>It will be necessary to prefix a few further
remarks on the Davidic psalms in general. Can
we tell which are David's? The Psalter, as is
generally known, is divided into five books or
parts, probably from some idea that it corresponded
with the Pentateuch. These five books
are marked by a doxology at the close of each,
except the last. The first portion consists of
Psa. i.-xli.; the second of Psa. xlii.-lxxii; the
third of Psa. lxxiii.-lxxxix; the fourth of Psa.
xc.-cvi.; and the fifth of Psa. cvii.-cl. The
psalms attributed to David are unequally distributed
through these five books. There are
seventy-three in all, and they run thus:&mdash;In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
first book there are thirty-seven; so that if we
regard psalms i. and ii. as a kind of double
introduction, a frontispiece and vignette title-page
to the whole collection, the first book proper
only two which are not regarded as David's.
The second book has a much smaller proportion,
only eighteen out of thirty-one. The third book
has but one, the fourth two; while the fifth has
fifteen, eight of which (cxxxviii.-cxlv.) occur
almost at the close. The intention is obvious&mdash;to
throw the Davidic psalms as much as possible
together in the first two books. And the inference
is not unnatural that these may have
formed an earlier collection, to which were afterwards
added the remaining three, with a considerable
body of alleged psalms of David,
which had subsequently come to light, placed side
by side at the end, so as to round off the whole.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, one thing is clear from the
arrangement of the Psalter, namely, that the
superscriptions which give the authors' names
are at least as old as the collection itself; for
they have guided the order of the collection in
the grouping not only of Davidic psalms, but
also of those attributed to the sons of Korah
(xlii.-xlix.) and to Asaph (lxxiii.-lxxxiii.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span></p>

<p>The question of the reliableness of these
superscriptions is hotly debated. The balance
of modern opinion is decidedly against their
genuineness. As in greater matters, so here
"the higher criticism" comes to the consideration
of their claims with a prejudice against
them, and on very arbitrary grounds determines
for itself, quite irrespective of these ancient
voices, the date and authorship of the psalms.
The extreme form of this tendency is to be
found in the masterly work of Ewald, who has
devoted all his vast power of criticism (and eked
it out with all his equally great power of confident
assertion) to the book, and has come to
the conclusion that we have but eleven of
David's psalms,&mdash;which is surely a result that
may lead to questionings as to the method
which has attained it.</p>

<p>These editorial notes are proved to be of extreme
antiquity by such considerations as these:
The Septuagint translators found them, and
did not understand them; the synagogue preserves
no traditions to explain them; the Book
of Chronicles throws no light upon them; they
are very rare in the two last books of the Psalter
(Delitzsch, ii. 393). In some cases they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
obviously erroneous, but in the greater number
there is nothing inconsistent with their correctness
in the psalms to which they are appended;
while very frequently they throw a flood of
light upon these, and all but prove their trustworthiness
by their appropriateness. They are
not authoritative, but they merit respectful consideration,
and, as Dr. Perowne puts it in his
valuable work on the Psalms, stand on a par
with the subscriptions to the Epistles in the New
Testament. Regarding them thus, and yet
examining the psalms to which they are prefixed,
there seem to be about forty-five which we may
attribute with some confidence to David, and
with these we shall be concerned in this book.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h2 class="space"><a name="EARLY" id="EARLY"></a>II.&mdash;EARLY DAYS.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>

<p>The life of David is naturally divided into
epochs, of which we may avail ourselves
for the more ready arrangement of our material.
These are&mdash;his early years up to his
escape from the court of Saul, his exile, the
prosperous beginning of his reign, his sin and
penitence, his flight before Absalom's rebellion,
and the darkened end.</p>

<p>We have but faint incidental traces of his life
up to his anointing by Samuel, with which the
narrative in the historical books opens. But
perhaps the fact that the story begins with that
consecration to office, is of more value than the
missing biography of his childhood could have
been. It teaches us the point of view from
which Scripture regards its greatest names&mdash;as
nothing, except in so far as they are God's instruments.
Hence its carelessness, notwithstanding
that so much of it is history, of all that
merely illustrates the personal character of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
heroes. Hence, too, the clearness with which,
notwithstanding that indifference, the living men
are set before us&mdash;the image cut with half a
dozen strokes of the chisel.</p>

<p>We do not know the age of David when
Samuel appeared in the little village with the
horn of sacred oil in his hand. The only approximation
to it is furnished by the fact, that
he was thirty at the beginning of his reign.
(2 Sam. v. 4.) If we take into account that his
exile must have lasted for a very considerable
period (one portion of it, his second flight to the
Philistines, was sixteen months, 1 Sam. xxvii.
7),&mdash;that the previous residence at the court of
Saul must have been long enough to give time
for his gradual rise to popularity, and thereafter
for the gradual development of the king's
insane hatred,&mdash;that further back still there was
an indefinite period, between the fight with
Goliath, and the first visit as a minstrel-physician
to the palace, which was spent at
Bethlehem, and that that visit itself cannot have
been very brief, since in its course he became
very dear and familiar to Saul,&mdash;it will not seem
that all these events could be crowded into less
than some twelve or fifteen years, or that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
could have been more than a lad of some sixteen
years of age when Samuel's hand smoothed
the sacred oil on his clustering curls.</p>

<p>How life had gone with him till then, we can
easily gather from the narrative of Scripture.
His father's household seems to have been one
in which modest frugality ruled. There is no
trace of Jesse having servants; his youngest
child does menial work; the present which he
sends to his king when David goes to court was
simple, and such as a man in humble life would
give&mdash;an ass load of bread, one skin of wine,
and one kid&mdash;his flocks were small&mdash;"a few
sheep." It would appear as if prosperity had
not smiled on the family since the days of Jesse's
grandfather, Boaz, that "mighty man of wealth."
David's place in the household does not seem to
have been a happy one. His father scarcely
reckoned him amongst his sons, and answers
Samuel's question, if the seven burly husbandmen
whom he has seen are all his children, with a
trace of contempt as he remembers that there
is another, "and, behold, he keepeth the sheep."
Of his mother we hear but once, and that
incidentally, for a moment, long after. His
brothers had no love for him, and do not appear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
to have shared either his heart or his fortunes.
The boy evidently had the usual fate of souls
like his, to grow up in uncongenial circumstances,
little understood and less sympathised with by
the common-place people round them, and
thrown back therefore all the more decisively
upon themselves. The process sours and spoils
some, but it is the making of more&mdash;and where,
as in this case, the nature is thrown back upon
God, and not on its own morbid operation,
strength comes from repression, and sweetness
from endurance. He may have received some
instruction in one of Samuel's schools for the
prophets, but we are left in entire ignorance of
what outward helps to unfold itself were given
to his budding life.</p>

<p>Whatever others he had, no doubt those which
are emphasized in the Bible story were the chief,
namely, his occupation and the many gifts
which it brought to him. The limbs, "like
hinds' feet," the sinewy arms which "broke a
bow of steel," the precision with which he used
the sling, the agility which "leaped over a
rampart," the health that glowed in his "ruddy"
face, were the least of his obligations to the
breezy uplands, where he kept his father's sheep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
His early life taught him courage, when he
"smote the lion" and laid hold by his ugly
muzzle of the bear that "rose against him,"
rearing itself upright for the fatal hug. Solitude
and familiarity with nature helped to nurture
the poetical side of his character, and to
strengthen that meditative habit which blends
so strangely with his impetuous activity, and
which for the most part kept tumults and toils
from invading his central soul. They threw him
back on God who peopled the solitude and
spoke in all nature. Besides this, he acquired
in the sheepcote lessons which he practised on
the throne, that rule means service, and that
the shepherd of men holds his office in order
that he may protect and guide. And in the
lowly associations of his humble home, he
learned the life of the people, their simple joys,
their unconspicuous toils, their unnoticed sorrows&mdash;a
priceless piece of knowledge both for
the poet and for the king.</p>

<p>A breach in all the tranquil habits of this
modest life was made by Samuel's astonishing
errand. The story is told with wonderful
picturesqueness and dramatic force. The minute
account of the successive rejections of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
brothers, Samuel's question and Jesse's answer,
and then the pause of idle waiting till the messenger
goes and returns, heighten the expectation
with which we look for his appearance.
And then what a sweet young face is lovingly
painted for us! "He was ruddy, and withal of
a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to"
(1 Sam. xvi. 12)&mdash;of fair complexion, with
golden hair, which is rare among these swarthy,
black-locked easterns, with lovely eyes (for that
is the meaning of the words which the English
Bible renders "of a beautiful countenance"),
large and liquid as become a poet. So he stood
before the old prophet, and with swelling heart
and reverent awe received the holy chrism. In
silence, as it would seem, Samuel anointed him.
Whether the secret of his high destiny was imparted
to him then, or left to be disclosed in
future years, is not told. But at all events,
whether with full understanding of what was
before him or no, he must have been conscious
of a call that would carry him far away from
the pastures and olive yards of the little hamlet
and of a new Spirit stirring in him from that
day forward.</p>

<p>This sudden change in all the outlook of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
life must have given new materials for thought
when he went back to his humble task. Responsibility,
or the prospect of it, makes lads
into men very quickly. Graver meditations,
humbler consciousness of weakness, a firmer
trust in God who had laid the burden upon him,
would do in days the work of years. And the
necessity for bidding back the visions of the
future in order to do faithfully the obscure
duties of the present, would add self-control and
patience, not usually the graces of youth. How
swiftly he matured is singularly shown in the
next recorded incident&mdash;his summons to the
court of Saul, by the character of him drawn by
the courtier who recommends him to the king.
He speaks of David in words more suitable to a
man of established renown than to a stripling.
He is minstrel and warrior, "cunning in playing,
and a mighty valiant man," and "skilled in
speech (already eloquent), and fair in form, and
the Lord is with him." (1 Sam. xvi. 18.) So
quickly had the new circumstances and the
energy of the Spirit of God, like tropical sunshine,
ripened his soul.</p>

<p>That first visit to the court was but an
episode in his life, however helpful to his growth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
it may have been. It would give him the
knowledge of new scenes, widen his experience,
and prepare him for the future. But it cannot
have been of very long duration. Possibly his
harp lost its power over Saul's gloomy spirit,
when he had become familiar with its notes.
For whatever reason, he returned to his father's
house, and gladly exchanged the favour at
court, which might have seemed to a merely
ambitious man the first step towards fulfilling
the prophecy of Samuel's anointing, for the
freedom of the pastoral solitudes about Bethlehem.
There he remained, living to outward
seeming as in the quiet days before these two
great earthquakes in his life, but with deeper
thoughts and new power, with broader experience,
and a wider horizon, until the hour when
he was finally wrenched from his seclusion,
and flung into the whirlpool of his public
career.</p>

<p>There are none of David's psalms which can
be with any certainty referred to this first period
of his life; but it has left deep traces on many
of them. The allusions to natural scenery and
the frequent references to varying aspects of
the shepherd's life are specimens of these. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
characteristic of the poetic temperament is the
faithful remembrance and cherishing of early
days. How fondly he recalled them is shown
in that most pathetic incident of his longing, as
a weary exile, for one draught of water from
the well at Bethlehem&mdash;where in the dear old
times he had so often led his flocks.</p>

<p>But though we cannot say confidently that
we have any psalms prior to his first exile, there
are several which, whatever their date may be,
are echoes of his thoughts in these first days.
This is especially the case in regard to the
group which describe varying aspects of nature&mdash;viz.,
Psalms xix., viii., xxix. They are unlike
his later psalms in the almost entire absence
of personal references, or of any trace of pressing
cares, or of signs of a varied experience of
human life. In their self-forgetful contemplation
of nature, in their silence about sorrow, in
their tranquil beauty, they resemble the youthful
works of many a poet whose later verse
throbs with quivering consciousness of life's
agonies, or wrestles strongly with life's problems.
They may not unnaturally be regarded
as the outpouring of a young heart at leisure
from itself, and from pain, far from men and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
very near God. The fresh mountain air of
Bethlehem blows through them, and the dew of
life's quiet morning is on them. The early
experience supplied their materials, whatever
was the date of their composition; and in them
we can see what his inward life was in these
budding years. The gaze of child-like wonder
and awe upon the blazing brightness of the
noonday, and on the mighty heaven with all its
stars, the deep voice with which all creation
spoke of God, the great thoughts of the dignity
of man (thoughts ever welcome to lofty youthful
souls), the gleaming of an inward light brighter
than all suns, the consciousness of mysteries of
weakness which may become miracles of sin in
one's own heart, the assurance of close relation
to God as His anointed and His servant, the cry
for help and guidance&mdash;all this is what we
should expect David to have thought and felt
as he wandered among the hills, alone with God;
and this is what these psalms give us.</p>

<p>Common to them all is the peculiar manner
of looking upon nature, so uniform in David's
psalms, so unlike more modern descriptive
poetry. He can smite out a picture in a phrase,
but he does not care to paint landscapes. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
feels the deep analogies between man and his
dwelling-place, but he does not care to lend to
nature a shadowy life, the reflection of our own.
Creation is to him neither a subject for poetical
description, nor for scientific examination. It
is nothing but the garment of God, the
apocalypse of the heavenly. And common to
them all is also the swift transition from the
outward facts which reveal God, to the spiritual
world, where His presence is, if it were possible,
yet more needful, and His operations yet
mightier. And common to them all is a certain
rush of full thought and joyous power, which is
again a characteristic of youthful work, and is
unlike the elegiac tenderness and pathos of
David's later hymns.</p>

<p>The nineteenth Psalm paints for us the glory
of the heavens by day, as the eighth by night.
The former gathers up the impressions of many
a fresh morning when the solitary shepherd-boy
watched the sun rising over the mountains of
Moab, which close the eastern view from the
hills above Bethlehem. The sacred silence of
dawn, the deeper hush of night, have voice for
his ear. "No speech! and no words! unheard is
their voice." But yet, "in all the earth goeth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
forth their line,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> and in the end of the habitable
world their sayings." The heavens and the
firmament, the linked chorus of day and night,
are heralds of God's glory, with silent speech,
heard in all lands, an unremitting voice. And
as he looks, there leaps into the eastern heavens,
not with the long twilight of northern lands, the
sudden splendour, the sun radiant as a bridegroom
from the bridal chamber, like some
athlete impatient for the course. How the joy
of morning and its new vigour throb in the
words! And then he watches the strong runner
climbing the heavens till the fierce heat beats
down into the deep cleft of the Jordan, and all
the treeless southern hills, as they slope towards
the desert, lie bare and blazing beneath the
beams.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> Their boundary, <i>i.e.</i>, their territory, or the region through
which their witness extends. Others render "their chord," or
sound (LXX. Ewald, etc.)</p></div>

<p>The sudden transition from the revelation of
God in nature to His voice in the law, has
seemed to many critics unaccountable, except
on the supposition that this psalm is made up
of two fragments, put together by a later compiler;
and some of them have even gone so far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
as to maintain that "the feeling which saw God
revealed in the law did not arise till the time
of Josiah."<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> But such a hypothesis is not required
to explain either the sudden transition or
the difference in style and rhythm between the
two parts of the psalm, which unquestionably
exists. The turn from the outer world to the
better light of God's word, is most natural; the
abruptness of it is artistic and impressive; the
difference of style and measure gives emphasis
to the contrast. There is also an obvious connection
between the two parts, inasmuch as the
law is described by epithets, which in part hint
at its being a brighter sun, enlightening the eyes.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> "Psalms chronologically arranged"&mdash;following Ewald.</p></div>

<p>The Word which declares the will of the Lord
is better than the heavens which tell His glory.
The abundance of synonyms for that word
show how familiar to his thoughts it was.
To him it is "the law," "the testimonies" by
which God witnesses of Himself and of man:
"the statutes," the fixed settled ordinances;
that which teaches "the fear of God," the
"judgments" or utterances of His mind on
human conduct. They are "perfect, firm, right,
clean, pure,"&mdash;like that spotless sun&mdash;"eternal,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
true." "They quicken, make wise, enlighten,"
even as the light of the lower world. His heart
prizes them "more than gold," of which in his
simple life he knew so little; more than "the
honey," which he had often seen dropping from
"the comb" in the pastures of the wilderness.</p>

<p>And then the twofold contemplation rises
into the loftier region of prayer. He feels that
there are dark depths in his soul, gloomier pits
than any into which the noontide sun shines.
He speaks as one who is conscious of dormant
evils, which life has not yet evolved, and his
prayer is more directed towards the future than
the past, and is thus very unlike the tone of the
later psalms, that wail out penitence and plead
for pardon. "Errors," or weaknesses,&mdash;"faults"
unknown to himself,&mdash;"high-handed sins,"<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>&mdash;such
is the climax of the evils from which he
prays for deliverance. He knows himself "Thy
servant" (2 Sam. vii. 5, 8; Psa. lxxviii. 70)&mdash;an
epithet which may refer to his consecration to
God's work by Samuel's anointing. He needs
not only a God who sets His glory in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
heavens, nor even one whose will is made
known, but one who will touch his spirit,&mdash;not
merely a Maker, but a pardoning God; and his
faith reaches its highest point as his song closes
with the sacred name of the covenant Jehovah,
repeated for the seventh time, and invoked in
one final aspiration of a trustful heart, as "my
Rock, and my Redeemer."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_D_4" id="Footnote_D_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> The form of the word would make "reckless men" a more
natural translation; but probably the context requires a third,
more aggravated sort of sin.</p></div>

<p>The eighth psalm is a companion picture, a
night-piece, which, like the former, speaks of
many an hour of lonely brooding below the
heavens, whether its composition fall within this
early period or no. The prophetic and doctrinal
value of the psalms is not our main subject
in the present volume, so that we have to
touch but very lightly on this grand hymn.
What does it show us of the singer? We see
him, like other shepherds on the same hills, long
after "keeping watch over his flocks by night,"
and overwhelmed by all the magnificence of an
eastern sky, with its lambent lights. So bright,
so changeless, so far,&mdash;how great they are, how
small the boy that gazes up so wistfully. Are
they gods, as all but his own nation believed?
No,&mdash;"the work of Thy fingers," "which Thou
hast ordained." The consciousness of God as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
their Maker delivers from the temptation of
confounding bigness with greatness, and wakes
into new energy that awful sense of personality
which towers above all the stars. He is a babe
and suckling&mdash;is that a trace of the early composition
of the psalm?&mdash;still he knows that out
of his lips, already beginning to break into song,
and out of the lips of his fellows, God perfects
praise. There speaks the sweet singer of Israel,
prizing as the greatest of God's gifts his growing
faculty, and counting his God-given words as
nobler than the voice of "night unto night."
God's fingers made these, but God's own breath
is in him. God ordained them, but God visits
him. The description of man's dignity and
dominion indicates how familiar David was
with the story in Genesis. It may perhaps also,
besides all the large prophetic truths which it
contains, have some special reference to his own
earlier experience. It is at least worth noting
that he speaks of the dignity of man as kingly,
like that which was dawning on himself, and
that the picture has no shadows either of sorrow
or of sin,&mdash;a fact which may point to his younger
days, when lofty thoughts of the greatness of
the soul are ever natural and when in his case<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
the afflictions and crimes that make their presence
felt in all his later works had not fallen
upon him. Perhaps, too, it may not be altogether
fanciful to suppose that we may see the
shepherd-boy surrounded by his flocks, and the
wild creatures that prowled about the fold, and
the birds asleep in their coverts beneath the
moonlight, in his enumeration of the subjects of
his first and happiest kingdom, where he ruled
far away from men and sorrow, seeing God
everywhere, and learning to perfect praise from
his youthful lips.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<hr />

<h2 class="space"><a name="DAYS" id="DAYS"></a>III.&mdash;EARLY DAYS&mdash;<i><span class="smcap">continued</span></i>.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>

<p>In addition to the psalms already considered,
which are devoted to the devout contemplation
of nature, and stand in close connection
with David's early days, there still remains one
universally admitted to be his. The twenty-ninth
psalm, like both the preceding, has to do
with the glory of God as revealed in the
heavens, and with earth only as the recipient of
skyey influences; but while these breathed the
profoundest tranquillity, as they watched the
silent splendour of the sun, and the peace of
moonlight shed upon a sleeping world, this is
all tumult and noise. It is a highly elaborate
and vivid picture of a thunderstorm, such as
must often have broken over the shepherd-psalmist
as he crouched under some shelf of
limestone, and gathered his trembling charge
about him. Its very structure reproduces in
sound an echo of the rolling peals reverberating
among the hills.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span></p>

<p>There is first an invocation, in the highest
strain of devout poetry, calling upon the "sons
of God," the angels who dwell above the lower
sky, and who see from above the slow gathering
of the storm-clouds, to ascribe to Jehovah the
glory of His name&mdash;His character as set forth in
the tempest. They are to cast themselves before
Him "in holy attire," as priests of the
heavenly sanctuary. Their silent and expectant
worship is like the brooding stillness
before the storm. We feel the waiting hush in
heaven and earth.</p>

<p>Then the tempest breaks. It crashes and
leaps through the short sentences, each like the
clap of the near thunder.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>a.</i> The voice of Jehovah (is) on the waters.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">The God of glory thunders.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;"><i>Jehovah (is) on many waters.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">The voice of Jehovah in strength!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">The voice of Jehovah in majesty!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>b.</i> The voice of Jehovah rending the cedars!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;"><i>And Jehovah rends the cedars of Lebanon</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">And makes them leap like a calf;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Lebanon and Sirion like a young buffalo</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">The voice of Jehovah hewing flashes of fire!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>c.</i> The voice of Jehovah shakes the desert,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;"><i>Jehovah shakes the Kadesh desert.</i></span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 9em;">The voice of Jehovah makes the hinds writhe<br />
And scathes the woods&mdash;and in His temple&mdash;<br />
&mdash;All in it (are) saying, "Glory."</p>

<p>Seven times the roar shakes the world. The
voice of the seven thunders is the voice of
Jehovah. In the short clauses, with their uniform
structure, the pause between, and the recurrence
of the same initial words, we hear the successive
peals, the silence that parts them, and the
monotony of their unvaried sound. Thrice we
have the reverberation rolling through the sky
or among the hills, imitated by clauses which
repeat previous ones, as indicated by the italics,
and one forked flame blazes out in the brief,
lightning-like sentence, "The voice of Jehovah
(is) hewing flashes of fire," which wonderfully
gives the impression of their streaming fiercely
forth, as if cloven from some solid block of fire,
their swift course, and their instantaneous extinction.</p>

<p>The range and effects of the storm, too, are
vividly painted. It is first "on the waters,"
which may possibly mean the Mediterranean,
but more probably, "the waters that are above
the firmament," and so depicts the clouds as
gathering high in air. Then it comes down with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
a crash on the northern mountains, splintering
the gnarled cedars, and making Lebanon rock
with all its woods&mdash;leaping across the deep
valley of C&#339;lo-Syria, and smiting Hermon (for
which Sirion is a Sidonian name), the crest of
the Anti Lebanon, till it reels. Onward it
sweeps&mdash;or rather, perhaps, it is all around the
psalmist; and even while he hears the voice
rolling from the furthest north, the extreme
south echoes the roar. The awful voice shakes<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
the wilderness, as it booms across its level surface.
As far south as Kadesh (probably Petra)
the tremor spreads, and away in the forests of
Edom the wild creatures in their terror slip their
calves, and the oaks are scathed and stripped of
their leafy honours. And all the while, like a
mighty diapason sounding on through the
tumult, the voice of the sons of God in the
heavenly temple is heard proclaiming "Glory!"</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_E_5" id="Footnote_E_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_E_5"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> Delitzsch would render "whirls in circles"&mdash;a picturesque
allusion to the sand pillars which accompany storms in the
desert.</p></div>

<p>The psalm closes with lofty words of confidence,
built on the story of the past, as well as
on the contemplation of the present. "Jehovah
sat throned for (<i>i.e.</i>, to send on earth) the flood"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
which once drowned the world of old. "Jehovah
will sit throned, a King for ever." That ancient
judgment spoke of His power over all the forces
of nature, in their most terrible form. So now
and for ever, all are His servants, and effect His
purposes. Then, as the tempest rolls away,
spent and transient, the sunshine streams out
anew from the softened blue over a freshened
world, and every raindrop on the leaves twinkles
into diamond light, and the end of the psalm is
like the after brightness; and the tranquil low
voice of its last words is like the songs of the
birds again as the departing storm growls low
and faint on the horizon. "The Lord will bless
His people with peace."</p>

<p>Thus, then, nature spoke to this young heart.
The silence was vocal; the darkness, bright; the
tumult, order&mdash;and all was the revelation of a
present God. It is told of one of our great
writers that, when a child, he was found lying
on a hill-side during a thunderstorm, and
at each flash clapping his hands and shouting,
unconscious of danger, and stirred to ecstasy.
David, too, felt all the poetic elevation, and
natural awe, in the presence of the crashing
storm; but he felt something more. To him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
the thunder was not a power to tremble before,
not a mere subject for poetic contemplation.
Still less was it something, the like of which
could be rubbed out of glass and silk, and
which he had done with when he knew its laws.
No increase of knowledge touching the laws of
physical phenomena in the least affects the
point of view which these Nature-psalms take.
David said, "God makes and moves all things."
We may be able to complete the sentence by a
clause which tells something of the methods of
His operation. But that is only a parenthesis
after all, and the old truth remains widened, not
overthrown by it. The psalmist knew that all
being and action had their origin in God. He
saw the last links of the chain, and knew that it
was rivetted to the throne of God, though the
intermediate links were unseen; and even the
fact that there were any was not present to his
mind. We know something of these; but the
first and the last of the series to him, are the
first and the last to us also. To us as to him,
the silent splendour of noonday speaks of God,
and the nightly heavens pour the soft radiance
of His "excellent name over all the earth." The
tempest is His voice, and the wildest commo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>tions
in nature and among men break in obedient
waves around His pillared throne.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"Well roars the storm to those who hear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">A deeper voice across the storm!"</span></p>

<p>There still remains one other psalm which
may be used as illustrating the early life of
David. The Twenty-third psalm is coloured
throughout by the remembrances of his youthful
occupation, even if its actual composition is of
a later date. Some critics, indeed, think that
the mention in the last verse of "the house of
the Lord" compels the supposition of an origin
subsequent to the building of the Temple; but
the phrase in question need not have anything
to do with tabernacle or temple, and is most
naturally accounted for by the preceding image
of God as the Host who feasts His servants at
His table. There are no other notes of time in
the psalm, unless, with some commentators, we
see an allusion in that image of the furnished
table to the seasonable hospitality of the Gileadite
chieftains during David's flight before Absalom
(2 Sam. xvii. 27-29)&mdash;a reference which
appears prosaic and flat. The absence of traces
of distress and sorrow&mdash;so constantly present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
in the later songs&mdash;may be urged with some
force in favour of the early date; and if we
follow one of the most valuable commentators
(Hupfeld) in translating all the verbs as futures,
and so make the whole a hymn of hope, we
seem almost obliged to suppose that we have
here the utterance of a youthful spirit, which
ventured to look forward, because it first looked
upward. In any case, the psalm is a transcript
of thoughts that had been born and cherished
in many a meditative hour among the lonely
hills of Bethlehem. It is the echo of the shepherd
life. We see in it the incessant care, the
love to his helpless charge, which was expressed
in and deepened by all his toil for them. He
had to think for their simplicity, to fight for
their defencelessness, to find their pasture, to
guard them while they lay amid the fresh
grass; sometimes to use his staff in order to
force their heedlessness with loving violence
past tempting perils; sometimes to guide them
through gloomy gorges, where they huddled
close at his heels; sometimes to smite the lion
and the bear that prowled about the fold&mdash;but
all was for their good and meant their comfort.
And thus he has learned, in preparation for his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
kingdom, the inmost meaning of pre-eminence
among men&mdash;and, more precious lesson still, thus
he has learned the very heart of God. Long
before, Jacob had spoken of Him as the "Shepherd
of Israel;" but it was reserved for David
to bring that sweet and wonderful name into
closer relations with the single soul; and, with
that peculiar enthusiasm of personal reliance,
and recognition of God's love to the individual
which stamps all his psalms, to say "The Lord
is my Shepherd." These dumb companions of
his, in their docility to his guidance, and absolute
trust in his care, had taught him the
secret of peace in helplessness, of patience in
ignorance. The green strips of meadow-land
where the clear waters brought life, the wearied
flocks sheltered from the mid-day heat, the quiet
course of the little stream, the refreshment of
the sheep by rest and pasture, the smooth paths
which he tried to choose for them, the rocky
defiles through which they had to pass, the rod
in his hand that guided, and chastised, and
defended, and was never lifted in anger,&mdash;all
these, the familiar sights of his youth, pass
before us as we read; and to us too, in our widely
different social state, have become the undying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
emblems of the highest care and the wisest love.
The psalm witnesses how close to the youthful
heart the consciousness of God must have been,
which could thus transform and glorify the little
things which were so familiar. We can feel, in
a kind of lazy play of sentiment, the fitness of the
shepherd's life to suggest thoughts of God&mdash;because
it is not our life. But it needs both a
meditative habit and a devout heart to feel that
the trivialities of our own daily tasks speak to
us of Him. The heavens touch the earth on
the horizon of our vision, but it always seems
furthest to the sky from the spot where we
stand. To the psalmist, however,&mdash;as in higher
ways to his Son and Lord,&mdash;all things around
him were full of God; and as the majesties of
nature, so the trivialities of man's works&mdash;shepherds
and fishermen&mdash;were solemn with deep
meanings and shadows of the heavenly. With
such lofty thoughts he fed his youth.</p>

<p>The psalm, too, breathes the very spirit of
sunny confidence and of perfect rest in God.
We have referred to the absence of traces of
sorrow, and to the predominant tone of hopefulness,
as possibly favouring the supposition of an
early origin. But it matters little whether they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
were young eyes which looked so courageously
into the unknown future, or whether we have
here the more solemn and weighty hopes of age,
which can have few hopes at all, unless they be
rooted in God. The spirit expressed in the
psalm is so thoroughly David's, that in his
younger days, before it was worn with responsibilities
and sorrows, it must have been especially
strong. We may therefore fairly take the tone
of this song of the Shepherd God as expressing
the characteristic of his godliness in the happy
early years. In his solitude he was glad. One
happy thought fills the spirit; one simple emotion
thrills the chords of his harp. No doubts,
or griefs, or remorse throw their shadows upon
him. He is conscious of dependence, but he is
above want and fear. He does not ask, he
has&mdash;he possesses God, and is at rest in Him. He
is satisfied with that fruition which blesseth all
who hunger for God, and is the highest form of
communion with Him. As the present has no
longings, the future has no terrors. All the
horizon is clear, all the winds are still, the ocean
at rest, "and birds of peace sit brooding on the
charmed wave." If there be foes, God holds
them back. If there lie far off among the hills<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
any valley of darkness, its black portals cast no
gloom over him, and will not when he enters.
God is his Shepherd, and, by another image,
God is his Host. The life which in one aspect,
by reason of its continual change, and occupation
with outward things, may be compared to
the journeyings of a flock, is in another aspect,
by reason of its inward union with the stability
of God, like sitting ever at the table which His
hand has spread as for a royal banquet, where
the oil of gladness glistens on every head, and
the full cup of Divine pleasure is in every hand.
For all the outward and pilgrimage aspect, the
psalmist knows that only Goodness and Mercy&mdash;these
two white-robed messengers of God&mdash;will
follow his steps, however long may be the
term of the days of his yet young life; for all
the inward, he is sure that, in calm, unbroken
fellowship, he will dwell in the house of God,
and that when the twin angels who fed and
guided him all his young life long have finished
their charge, and the days of his journeyings are
ended, there stretches beyond a still closer union
with his heavenly Friend, which will be perfected
in His true house "for ever." We look in vain
for another example, even in David's psalms, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
such perfect, restful trust in God. These clear
notes are perhaps the purest utterance ever given
of "the peace of God which passeth all understanding."</p>

<p>Such were the thoughts and hopes of the lad
who kept his father's sheep at Bethlehem. He
lived a life of lofty thoughts and lowly duties.
He heard the voice of God amidst the silence of
the hills, and the earliest notes of his harp
echoed the deep tones. He learned courage as
well as tenderness from his daily tasks, and
patience from the contrast between them and the
high vocation which Samuel's mysterious anointing
had opened before him. If we remember
how disturbing an influence the consciousness of
it might have wrought in a soul less filled with
God, we may perhaps accept as probably correct
the superscription which refers one sweet, simple
psalm to him, and may venture to suppose that
it expresses the contentment, undazzled by
visions of coming greatness, that calmed his
heart. "Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor
mine eyes lofty; neither do I exercise myself in
great matters, or in things too high for me.
Surely I have smoothed and quieted my soul: like
a weanling on his mother's (breast), like a wean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>ling
is my soul within me." (Psa. cxxxi.) So
lying in God's arms, and content to be folded in
His embrace, without seeking anything beyond,
he is tranquil in his lowly lot.</p>

<p>It does not fall within our province to follow
the course of the familiar narrative through the
picturesque events that led him to fame and
position at court. The double character of
minstrel and warrior, to which we have already
referred, is remarkably brought out in his double
introduction to Saul, once as soothing the king's
gloomy spirit with the harmonies of his shepherd's
harp, once as bringing down the boasting
giant of Gath with his shepherd's sling. On the
first occasion his residence in the palace seems
to have been ended by Saul's temporary recovery.
He returns to Bethlehem for an indefinite time,
and then leaves it and all its peaceful tasks for
ever. The dramatic story of the duel with
Goliath needs no second telling. His arrival at
the very crisis of the war, the eager courage with
which he leaves his baggage in the hands of the
guard and runs down the valley to the ranks of
the army, the busy hum of talk among the
Israelites, the rankling jealousy of his brother
that curdles into bitter jeers, the modest courage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
with which he offers himself as champion,
the youthful enthusiasm of brave trust in "the
Lord, that delivered me out of the paw of the lion,
and out of the paw of the bear;" the wonderfully
vivid picture of the young hero with his shepherd
staff in one hand, his sling in the other,
and the rude wallet by his side, which had
carried his simple meal, and now held the
smooth stone from the brook that ran between
the armies in the bottom of the little valley&mdash;the
blustering braggadocio of the big champion,
the boy's devout confidence in "the name of the
Lord of hosts;" the swift brevity of the narrative
of the actual fight, which in its hurrying
clauses seems to reproduce the light-footed
eagerness of the young champion, or the rapid
whizz of the stone ere it crashed into the thick
forehead; the prostrate bulk of the dead giant
prone upon the earth, and the conqueror, slight
and agile, hewing off the huge head with Goliath's
own useless sword;&mdash;all these incidents,
so full of character, so antique in manner,
so weighty with lessons of the impotence of
strength that is merely material, and the power
of a living enthusiasm of faith in God, may, for
our present purposes, be passed with a mere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
glance. One observation may, however, be
allowed. After the victory, Saul is represented
as not knowing who David was, and as sending
Abner to find out where he comes from. Abner,
too, professes entire ignorance; and when
David appears before the king, "with the head
of the Philistine in his hand," he is asked,
"Whose son art thou, young man?" It has
been thought that here we have an irreconcilable
contradiction with previous narratives, according
to which there was close intimacy between him
and the king, who "loved him greatly," and
gave him an office of trust about his person.
Suppositions of "dislocation of the narrative,"
the careless adoption by the compiler of two
separate legends, and the like, have been freely
indulged in. But it may at least be suggested
as a possible explanation of the seeming discrepancy,
that when Saul had passed out of his
moody madness it is not wonderful that he
should have forgotten all which had occurred in
his paroxysm. It is surely a common enough
psychological phenomenon that a man restored
to sanity has no remembrance of the events
during his mental aberration. And as for
Abner's profession of ignorance, an incipient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
jealousy of this stripling hero may naturally
have made the "captain of the host" willing to
keep the king as ignorant as he could concerning
a probable formidable rival. There is no
need to suppose he was really ignorant, but only
that it suited him to say that he was.</p>

<p>With this earliest deed of heroism the peaceful
private days are closed, and a new epoch of
court favour and growing popularity begins.
The impression which the whole story leaves
upon one is well summed up in a psalm which
the Septuagint adds to the Psalter. It is not
found in the Hebrew, and has no pretension to
be David's work; but, as a <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the salient
points of his early life, it may fitly end our considerations
of this first epoch.</p>

<p>"This is the autograph psalm of David, and
beyond the number (<i>i.e.</i>, of the psalms in the
Psalter), when he fought the single fight with
Goliath:&mdash;</p>

<p>"(1.) I was little among my brethren, and the
youngest in the house of my father: I kept the
flock of my father. (2.) My hands made a pipe,
my fingers tuned a psaltery. (3.) And who
shall tell it to my Lord? He is the Lord, He
shall hear me. (4.) He sent His angel (mes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>senger),
and took me from the flocks of my
father, and anointed me with the oil of His
anointing. (5.) But my brethren were fair and
large, and in them the Lord took not pleasure.
(6.) I went out to meet the Philistine, and he
cursed me by his idols. (7.) But I, drawing his
sword, beheaded him, and took away reproach
from the children of Israel."<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h2 class="space"><a name="EXILE_1" id="EXILE_1"></a>IV.&mdash;THE EXILE.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>

<p>David's first years at the court of Saul in
Gibeah do not appear to have produced
any psalms which still survive.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"The sweetest songs are those</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">Which tell of saddest thought."</span></p>

<p>It was natural, then, that a period full of novelty
and of prosperous activity, very unlike the quiet
days at Bethlehem, should rather accumulate
materials for future use than be fruitful in
actual production. The old life shut to behind
him for ever, like some enchanted door in a hill-side,
and an unexplored land lay beckoning
before. The new was widening his experience,
but it had to be mastered, to be assimilated by
meditation before it became vocal.</p>

<p>The bare facts of this section are familiar and
soon told. There is first a period in which he
is trusted by Saul, who sets him in high command,
with the approbation not only of the
people, but even of the official classes. But a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
new dynasty resting on military pre-eminence
cannot afford to let a successful soldier stand on
the steps of the throne; and the shrill chant of
the women out of all the cities of Israel, which
even in Saul's hearing answered the praises of
his prowess with a louder acclaim for David's
victories, startled the king for the first time with
a revelation of the national feeling. His unslumbering
suspicion "eyed David from that
day." Rage and terror threw him again into
the gripe of his evil spirit, and in his paroxysm
he flings his heavy spear, the symbol of his
royalty, at the lithe harper, with fierce vows of
murder. The failure of his attempt to kill
David seems to have aggravated his dread of
him as bearing a charm which won all hearts
and averted all dangers. A second stage is
marked not only by Saul's growing fear,
but by David's new position. He is removed
from court, and put in a subordinate command,
which only extends his popularity, and brings
him into more immediate contact with the mass
of the people. "All Israel and Judah loved
David, because he went out and came in before
them." Then follows the offer of Saul's elder
daughter in marriage, in the hope that by play<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>ing
upon his gratitude and his religious feeling,
he might be urged to some piece of rash bravery
that would end him without scandal. Some new
caprice of Saul's, however, leads him to insult
David by breaking his pledge at the last
moment, and giving the promised bride to
another. Jonathan's heart was not the only one
in Saul's household that yielded to his spell.
The younger Michal had been cherishing his
image in secret, and now tells her love. Her
father returns to his original purpose, with the
strange mixture of tenacity and capricious
changefulness that marks his character, and
again attempts, by demanding a grotesquely
savage dowry, to secure David's destruction.
But that scheme, too, fails; and he becomes a
member of the royal house.</p>

<p>This third stage is marked by Saul's deepening
panic hatred, which has now become a fixed
idea. All his attempts have only strengthened
David's position, and he looks on his irresistible
advance with a nameless awe. He calls, with
a madman's folly, on Jonathan and on all his
servants to kill him; and then, when his son
appeals to him, his old better nature comes over
him, and with a great oath he vows that David<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
shall not be slain. For a short time David
returns to Gibeah, and resumes his former
relations with Saul, but a new victory over the
Philistines rouses the slumbering jealousy. Again
the "evil spirit" is upon him, and the great
javelin is flung with blind fury, and sticks
quivering in the wall. It is night, and David
flies to his house. A stealthy band of assassins
from the palace surround the house with orders
to prevent all egress, and, by what may be
either the strange whim of a madman, or the
cynical shamelessness of a tyrant, to slay him
in the open daylight. Michal, who, though in
after time she showed a strain of her father's
proud godlessness, and an utter incapacity of
understanding the noblest parts of her husband's
character, seems to have been a true wife in
these early days, discovers, perhaps with a
woman's quick eye sharpened by love, the
crouching murderers, and with rapid promptitude
urges immediate flight. Her hands let
him down from the window&mdash;the house being
probably on the wall. Her ready wit dresses
up one of those mysterious teraphim (which
appear to have had some connection with
idolatry or magic, and which are strange pieces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
of furniture for David's house), and lays it in the
bed to deceive the messengers, and so gain a
little more time before pursuit began. "So
David fled and escaped, and came to Samuel to
Ramah," and thus ended his life at court.</p>

<p>Glancing over this narrative, one or two points
come prominently forth. The worth of these
events to David must have lain chiefly in the
abundant additions made to his experience of
life, which ripened his nature, and developed
new powers. The meditative life of the sheepfold
is followed by the crowded court and camp.
Strenuous work, familiarity with men, constant
vicissitude, take the place of placid thought, of
calm seclusion, of tranquil days that knew no
changes but the alternation of sun and stars,
storm and brightness, green pastures and dusty
paths. He learned the real world, with its
hate and effort, its hollow fame and its whispering
calumnies. Many illusions no doubt faded,
but the light that had shone in his solitude still
burned before him for his guide, and a deeper
trust in his Shepherd God was rooted in his
soul by all the shocks of varying fortune. The
passage from the visions of youth and the solitary
resolves of early and uninterrupted piety to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
the naked realities of a wicked world, and the
stern self-control of manly godliness, is ever painful
and perilous. Thank God! it may be made
clear gain, as it was by this young hero psalmist.</p>

<p>David's calm indifference to outward circumstances
affecting himself, is very strikingly expressed
in his conduct. Partly from his poetic
temperament, partly from his sweet natural
unselfishness, and chiefly from his living trust in
God, he accepts whatever happens with equanimity,
and makes no effort to alter it. He
originates nothing. Prosperity comes unsought,
and dangers unfeared. He does not ask for
Jonathan's love, or the people's favour, or the
women's songs, or Saul's daughter. If Saul
gives him command he takes it, and does his
work. If Saul flings his javelin at him, he
simply springs aside and lets it whizz past. If
his high position is taken from him, he is quite
content with a lower. If a royal alliance is
offered, he accepts it; if it is withdrawn, he is
not ruffled; if renewed, he is still willing. If a
busy web of intrigue is woven round him, he
takes no notice. If reconciliation is proposed,
he cheerfully goes back to the palace. If his
life is threatened he goes home. He will not stir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
to escape but for the urgency of his wife. So
well had he already begun to learn the worthlessness
of life's trifles. So thoroughly does he
practice his own precept, "Fret not thyself
because of evil-doers;" "rest in the Lord, and
wait patiently for Him." (Psa. xxxvii. 1, 7.)</p>

<p>This section gives also a remarkable impression
of the irresistible growth of his popularity
and influence. The silent energy of the Divine
purpose presses his fortunes onward with a
motion slow and inevitable as that of a glacier.
The steadfast flow circles unchecked round, or
rises victorious over all hindrances. Efforts to
ruin, to degrade, to kill&mdash;one and all fail.
Terror and hate, suspicion and jealousy, only
bring him nearer the goal. A clause which
comes in thrice in the course of one chapter,
expresses this fated advance. In the first stage
of his court life, we read, "David prospered"
(1 Sam. xviii. 5, margin), and again with increased
emphasis it is told as the result of the
efforts to crush him, that, "He prospered in all
his ways, and the Lord was with him" (verse
14), and yet again, in spite of Saul's having
"become his enemy continually," he "prospered
more than all the servants of Saul" (verse 30).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
He moves onward as stars in their courses
move, obeying the equable impulse of the calm
and conquering will of God.</p>

<p>The familiar Scripture antithesis, which naturally
finds its clearest utterance in the words of
the last inspired writer&mdash;namely, the eternal
opposition of Light and Darkness, Love and
Hate, Life and Death, is brought into sharpest
relief by the juxtaposition and contrast of David
and Saul. This is the key to the story. The
two men are not more unlike in person than in
spirit. We think of the one with his ruddy
beauty and changeful eyes, and lithe slight form,
and of the other gaunt and black, his giant
strength weakened, and his "goodly" face
scarred with the lightnings of his passions&mdash;and
as they look so they are. The one full of joyous
energy, the other devoured by gloom; the
one going in and out among the people and
winning universal love, the other sitting moody
and self-absorbed behind his palace walls; the
one bringing sweet clear tones of trustful praise
from his harp, the other shaking his huge spear
in his madness; the one ready for action and
prosperous in it all, the other paralyzed, shrinking
from all work, and leaving the conduct of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
the war to the servant whom he feared; the one
conscious of the Divine presence making him
strong and calm, the other writhing in the gripe
of his evil spirit, and either foaming in fury, or
stiffened into torpor; the one steadily growing
in power and favour with God and man, the
other sinking in deeper mire, and wrapped
about with thickening mists as he moves to his
doom. The tragic pathos of these two lives in
their fateful antagonism is the embodiment of
that awful alternative of life and death, blessing
and cursing, which it was the very aim of
Judaism to stamp ineffaceably on the conscience.</p>

<p>David's flight begins a period to which a large
number of his psalms are referred. We may
call them "The Songs of the Outlaw." The
titles in the psalter connect several with specific
events during his persecution by Saul, and
besides these, there are others which have
marked characteristics in common, and may
therefore be regarded as belonging to the same
time. The bulk of the former class are found in
the second book of the psalter (Ps. xlii.-lxxii.),
which has been arranged with some care. There
are first eight Korahite psalms, and one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
Asaph's; then a group of fifteen Davidic (li.-lxv.),
followed by two anonymous; then three
more of David's (lxviii.-lxx.), followed by one
anonymous and the well-known prayer "for
Solomon." Now it is worth notice that the
group of fifteen psalms ascribed to David is as
nearly as possible divided in halves, eight having
inscriptions which give a specific date of composition,
and seven having no such detail.
There has also been some attempt at arranging
the psalms of these two classes alternately, but
that has not been accurately carried out. These
facts show that the titles are at all events as old
as the compilation of the second book of the
psalter, and were regarded as accurate then.
Several points about the complete book of
psalms as we have it, seem to indicate that these
two first books were an older nucleus, which was
in existence long prior to the present collection&mdash;and
if so, the date of the titles must be carried
back a very long way indeed, and with a proportionate
increase of authority.</p>

<p>Of the eight psalms in the second book
having titles with specific dates, five (Ps.
lii., liv., lvi., lvii., lix.) are assigned to the
period of the Sauline persecution, and, as it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
would appear, with accuracy. There is a
general similarity of tone in them all, as well
as considerable parallelisms of expression, favourite
phrases and metaphors, which are favourable
to the hypothesis of a nearly cotemporaneous
date. They are all in what, to use a
phrase from another art, we may call David's
earlier manner. For instance, in all the psalmist
is surrounded by enemies. They would "swallow
him up" (lvi. 1, 2; lvii. 3). They "oppress"
him (liv. 3; lvi. 1). One of their weapons is
calumny, which seems from the frequent references
to have much moved the psalmist. Their
tongues are razors (lii. 2), or swords (lvii. 4;
lix. 7; lxiv. 3). They seem to him like crouching
beasts ready to spring upon harmless prey
(lvi. 6; lvii. 6; lix. 3); they are "lions" (lvii. 4),
dogs (lix. 6, 14). He is conscious of nothing
which he has done to provoke this storm of
hatred (lix. 3; lxiv. 4.) The "strength" of God
is his hope (liv. 1; lix. 9, 17). He is sure that
retribution will fall upon the enemies (lii. 5;
liv. 5; lvi. 7; lvii. 6; lix. 8-15; lxiv. 7, 8).
He vows and knows that psalms of deliverance
will yet succeed these plaintive cries (lii. 9;
liv. 7; lvi. 12; lvii. 7-11; lix. 16, 17).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span></p>

<p>We also find a considerable number of psalms
in the first book of the psalter which present
the same features, and may therefore probably
be classed with these as belonging to the time
of his exile. Such for instance are the seventh
and thirty-fourth, which have both inscriptions
referring them to this period, with others which
we shall have to consider presently. The
imagery of the preceding group reappears in
them. His enemies are lions (vii. 2; xvii. 12;
xxii. 13; xxxv. 17); dogs (xxii. 16); bulls
(xxii. 12). Pitfalls and snares are in his path
(vii. 15; xxxi. 4; xxxv. 7). He passionately
protests his innocence, and the kindliness of his
heart to his wanton foes (vii. 3-5; xvii. 3, 4);
whom he has helped and sorrowed over in their
sickness (xxxv. 13, 14)&mdash;a reference, perhaps, to
his solacing Saul in his paroxysms with the
music of his harp. He dwells on retribution
with vehemence (vii. 11-16; xi. 5-7; xxxi.
23; xxxv. 8), and on his own deliverance with
confidence.</p>

<p>These general characteristics accurately correspond
with the circumstances of David during
the years of his wanderings. The scenery and
life of the desert colours the metaphors which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
describe his enemies as wild beasts; himself as
a poor hunted creature amongst pits and snares;
or as a timid bird flying to the safe crags, and
God as his Rock. Their strong assertions of
innocence accord with the historical indications
of Saul's gratuitous hatred, and appear to distinguish
the psalms of this period from those of
Absalom's revolt, in which the remembrance of
his great sin was too deep to permit of any such
claims. In like manner the prophecies of the
enemies' destruction are too triumphant to suit
that later time of exile, when the father's heart
yearned with misplaced tenderness over his
worthless son, and nearly broke with unkingly
sorrow for the rebel's death. Their confidence
in God, too, has in it a ring of joyousness in
peril which corresponds with the buoyant faith
that went with him through all the desperate
adventures and hairbreadth escapes of the
Sauline persecution. If then we may, with some
confidence, read these psalms in connection with
that period, what a noble portraiture of a brave,
devout soul looks out upon us from them. We
see him in the first flush of his manhood&mdash;somewhere
about five-and-twenty years old&mdash;fronting
perils of which he is fully conscious,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
with calm strength and an enthusiasm of trust
that lifts his spirit above them all, into a region
of fellowship with God which no tumult can invade,
and which no remembrance of black transgression
troubled and stained. His harp is his
solace in his wanderings; and while plaintive
notes are flung from its strings, as is needful for
the deepest harmonies of praise here, every wailing
tone melts into clear ringing notes of glad
affiance in the "God of his mercy."</p>

<p>Distinct references to the specific events of
his wanderings are, undoubtedly, rare in them,
though even these are more obvious than has
been sometimes carelessly assumed. Their infrequency
and comparative vagueness has been
alleged against the accuracy of the inscriptions
which allocate certain psalms to particular occasions.
But in so far as it is true that these allusions
are rare and inexact, the fact is surely
rather in favour of than against the correctness
of the titles. For if these are not suggested by
obvious references in the psalms to which they
are affixed, by what can they have been suggested
but by a tradition considerably older
than the compilation of the psalter? Besides,
the analogy of all other poetry would lead us to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
expect precisely what we find in these psalms&mdash;general
and not detailed allusions to the
writer's circumstances. The poetic imagination
does not reproduce the bald prosaic facts which
have set it in motion, but the echo of them
broken up and etherealised. It broods over
them till life stirs, and the winged creature
bursts from them to sing and soar.</p>

<p>If we accept the title as accurate, the fifty-ninth
psalm is the first of these Songs of the
Outlaw. It refers to the time "when Saul sent,
and they watched the house to kill him." Those
critics who reject this date, which they do on
very weak grounds, lose themselves in a chaos
of assumptions as to the occasion of the psalm.
The Chaldean invasion, the assaults in the time
of Nehemiah, and the era of the Maccabees, are
alleged with equal confidence and equal groundlessness.
"We believe that it is most advisable
to adhere to the title, and most scientific to
ignore these hypotheses built on nothing."
(Delitzsch.)</p>

<p>It is a devotional and poetic commentary on
the story in Samuel. There we get the bare
facts of the assassins prowling by night round
David's house; of Michal's warning; of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
ready-witted trick to gain time, and of his hasty
flight to Samuel at Ramah. In the narrative
David is, as usual at this period, passive and
silent; but when we turn to the psalm, we learn
the tone of his mind as the peril bursts upon
him, and all the vulgar craft and fear fades from
before his lofty enthusiasm of faith.</p>

<p>The psalm begins abruptly with a passionate
cry for help, which is repeated four times, thus
bringing most vividly before us the extremity
of the danger and the persistency of the suppliant's
trust. The peculiar tenderness and
closeness of his relation to his heavenly Friend,
which is so characteristic of David's psalms, and
which they were almost the first to express,
breathes through the name by which he invokes
help, "my God." The enemies are painted in
words which accurately correspond with the
history, and which by their variety reveal how
formidable they were to the psalmist. They
"lie in wait (literally weave plots) for my life."
They are "workers of iniquity," "men of blood,"
insolent or violent ("mighty" in English version).
He asserts his innocence, as ever in these
Sauline psalms, and appeals to God in confirmation,
"not for my transgressions, nor for my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
sins, O Lord." He sees these eager tools of
royal malice hurrying to their congenial work:
"they run and prepare themselves." And then,
rising high above all encompassing evils, he
grasps at the throne of God in a cry, which
gains additional force when we remember that
the would-be murderers compassed his house in
the night. "Awake to meet me, and behold;"
as if he had said, "In the darkness do Thou see;
at midnight sleep not Thou." The prayer is
continued in words which heap together with
unwonted abundance the Divine names, in each
of which lie an appeal to God and a pillar of
faith. As Jehovah, the self-existent Fountain
of timeless Being; as the God of Hosts, the
Commander of all the embattled powers of the
universe, whether they be spiritual or material;
as the <span class="smcap">God</span> of Israel, who calls that people His,
and has become theirs&mdash;he stirs up the strength
of God to "awake to visit all the heathen,"&mdash;a
prayer which has been supposed to compel the
reference of the whole psalm to the assaults of
Gentile nations, but which may be taken as an
anticipation on David's lips of the truth that,
"They are not all Israel which are of Israel."
After a terrible petition&mdash;"Be not merciful to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
any secret plotters of evil"&mdash;there is a pause
(Selah) to be filled, as it would appear, by some
chords on the harp, or the blare of the trumpets,
thus giving time to dwell on the previous petitions.</p>

<p>But still the thought of the foe haunts him,
and he falls again to the lower level of painting
their assembling round his house, and their
whispers as they take their stand. It would
appear that the watch had been kept up for
more than one night. How he flings his growing
scorn of them into the sarcastic words,
"They return at evening; they growl like a dog,
and compass the city" (or "go their rounds in
the city"). One sees them stealing through the
darkness, like the troops of vicious curs that
infest Eastern cities, and hears their smothered
threatenings as they crouch in the shadow of
the unlighted streets. Then growing bolder, as
the night deepens and sleep falls on the silent
houses: "Behold they pour out with their mouth,
swords (are) in their lips, for 'who hears'?" In
magnificent contrast with these skulking murderers
fancying themselves unseen and unheard,
David's faith rends the heaven, and, with a
daring image which is copied in a much later<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
psalm (ii. 4), shows God gazing on them with
Divine scorn which breaks in laughter and
mockery. A brief verse, which recurs at the end
of the psalm, closes the first portion of the
psalm with a calm expression of untroubled
trust, in beautiful contrast with the peril
and tumult of soul, out of which it rises
steadfast and ethereal, like a rainbow spanning
a cataract. A slight error appears to have crept
into the Hebrew text, which can be easily
corrected from the parallel verse at the end,
and then the quiet confident words are&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"My strength! upon Thee will I wait,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">For God is my fortress!"</span></p>

<p>The second portion is an intensification of
the first; pouring out a terrible prayer for exemplary
retribution on his enemies; asking that no
speedy destruction may befall them, but that
God would first of all "make them reel" by the
blow of His might; would then fling them prostrate;
would make their pride and fierce words
a net to snare them; and then, at last, would
bring them to nothing in the hot flames of His
wrath&mdash;that the world may know that He is king.
The picture of the prowling dogs recurs with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
deepened scorn and firmer confidence that they
will hunt for their prey in vain.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"And they return at evening; they growl like a dog,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">And compass the city.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">They&mdash;they prowl about for food</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">If (or, since) they are not satisfied, they spend the night (in the search.)"</span></p>

<p>There is almost a smile on his face as he
thinks of their hunting about for him, like
hungry hounds snuffing for their meal in the
kennels, and growling now in disappointment&mdash;while
he is safe beyond their reach. And the
psalm ends with a glad burst of confidence,
and a vow of praise very characteristic on his
lips&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"But I&mdash;I will sing Thy power,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">And shout aloud, in the morning, Thy mercy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">For Thou hast been a fortress for me.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">And a refuge in the day of my trouble.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">My strength! unto Thee will I harp,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">For God is my fortress&mdash;the God of my mercy."</span></p>

<p>Thrice he repeats the vow of praise. His harp
was his companion in his flight, and even in the
midst of peril the poet's nature appears which
regards all life as materials for song, and the
devout spirit appears which regards all trial as
occasions for praise. He has calmed his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
spirit, as he had done Saul's, by his song, and by
prayer has swung himself clear above fightings
and fears. The refrain, which occurs twice in
the psalm, witnesses to the growth of his faith
even while he sings. At first he could only say
in patient expectance, "My strength! I will
wait upon thee, for God is my fortress." But at
the end his mood is higher, his soul has caught
fire as it revolves, and his last words are a
triumphant amplification of his earlier trust:
"My strength! unto thee will I sing with the
harp&mdash;for God is my fortress&mdash;the God of my
mercy."<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h2 class="space"><a name="EXILE_2" id="EXILE_2"></a>V.&mdash;THE EXILE&mdash;<span class="smcap"><i>continued</i>.</span></h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>

<p>"So David fled, and escaped and came to
Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that
Saul had done unto him. And he and Samuel
went and dwelt in Naioth" (1 Sam. xix. 18)&mdash;or,
as the word probably means, in the collection
of students' dwellings, inhabited by the sons of
the prophets, where possibly there may have
been some kind of right of sanctuary. Driven
thence by Saul's following him, and having had
one last sorrowful hour of Jonathan's companionship&mdash;the
last but one on earth&mdash;he fled to
Nob, whither the ark had been carried after the
destruction of Shiloh. The story of his flight
had not reached the solitary little town among
the hills, and he is received with the honour due
to the king's son-in-law. He pleads urgent
secret business for Saul as a reason for his
appearance with a slender retinue, and unarmed;
and the priest, after some feeble scruples, supplies
the handful of hungry fugitives with the shew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>bread.
But David's quick eye caught a swarthy
face peering at him from some enclosure of the
simple forest sanctuary, and as he recognised
Doeg the Edomite, Saul's savage herdsman, a
cold foreboding of evil crept over his heart, and
made him demand arms from the peaceful
priest. The lonely tabernacle was guarded by
its own sanctity, and no weapons were there,
except one trophy which was of good omen to
David&mdash;Goliath's sword. He eagerly accepts
the matchless weapon which his hand had
clutched on that day of danger and deliverance,
and thus armed, lest Doeg should try to bar his
flight, he hurries from the pursuit which he knew
that the Edomite's malignant tongue would
soon bring after him. The tragical end of the
unsuspecting priest's kindness brings out the
furious irrational suspicion and cruelty of Saul.
He rages at his servants as leagued with David
in words which have a most dreary sound of
utter loneliness sighing through all their fierce
folly: "All of you have conspired against me;
there is none of you that is sorry for me" (1
Sam. xxii. 8.) Doeg is forward to curry favour
by telling his tale, and so tells it as to suppress
the priest's ignorance of David's flight, and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
represent him as aiding and comforting the
rebel knowingly. Then fierce wrath flames out
from the darkened spirit, and the whole priestly
population of Nob are summoned before him,
loaded with bitter reproaches, their professions
of innocence disregarded, and his guard ordered
to murder them all then and there. The very
soldiers shrink from the sacrilege, but a willing
tool is at hand. The wild blood of Edom, fired
by ancestral hatred, desires no better work, and
Doeg crowns his baseness by slaying&mdash;with the
help of his herdsmen, no doubt&mdash;"on that day
fourscore and five persons that did wear an
ephod," and utterly extirpating every living
thing from the defenceless little city.</p>

<p>One psalm, the fifty-second, is referred by its
inscription to this period, but the correspondence
between the history and the tone of the
psalm is doubtful. It is a vehement rebuke and
a prophecy of destruction directed against an
enemy, whose hostility was expressed in "devouring
words." The portrait does not apply very
accurately to the Doeg of the historical books,
inasmuch as it describes the psalmist's enemy
as "a mighty man,"&mdash;or rather as "a hero," and
as trusting "in the abundance of his riches,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>&mdash;and
makes the point of the reproach against
him that he is a confirmed liar. But the
dastardly deed of blood may be covertly alluded
to in the bitterly sarcastic "hero"&mdash;as if he had
said, "O brave warrior, who dost display thy
prowess in murdering unarmed priests and
women?" And Doeg's story to Saul was a
lie in so far as it gave the impression of the
priests' complicity with David, and thereby
caused their deaths on a false charge. The
other features of the description are not contrary
to the narrative, and most of them are
in obvious harmony with it. The psalm, then,
may be taken as showing how deeply David's
soul was stirred by the tragedy. He pours out
broken words of hot and righteous indignation:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"Destructions doth thy tongue devise,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">Like a razor whetted&mdash;O thou worker of deceit."</span></p><br />

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"Thou lovest all words that devour:<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> O thou deceitful tongue!"</span></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_F_6" id="Footnote_F_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_F_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> Literally, "words of swallowing up."</p></div>

<p>He prophesies the destruction of the cruel liar,
and the exultation of the righteous when he
falls, in words which do indeed belong to the
old covenant of retribution, and yet convey an
eternal truth which modern sentimentalism finds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
very shocking, but which is witnessed over and
over again in the relief that fills the heart of
nations and of individuals when evil men fade:
"When the wicked perish, there is shouting"&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"Also God shall smite thee down for ever,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">Will draw thee out,<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> and carry thee away from the tent,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">And root thee out of the land of the living;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">And the righteous shall see and fear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">And over him shall they laugh."</span></p>

<p>In confident security he opposes his own happy
fellowship with God to this dark tragedy of
retribution:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"But I&mdash;(I am) like a green olive tree in the house of God."</span></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_G_7" id="Footnote_G_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_G_7"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> The full force of the word is, "will pluck out as a glowing
ember from a hearth" (Delitzsch).</p></div>

<p>The enemy was to be "rooted out;" the
psalmist is to flourish by derivation of life and
vigour from God. If Robinson's conjecture
that Nob was on the Mount of Olives were
correct (which is very doubtful), the allusion
here would gain appropriateness. As the olives
grew all round the humble forest sanctuary,
and were in some sort hallowed by the shrine
which they encompassed, so the soul grows and
is safe in loving fellowship with God. Be that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
as it may, the words express the outlaw's
serene confidence that he is safe beneath the
sheltering mercy of God, and re-echo the hopes
of his earlier psalm, "I will dwell in the house
of the Lord for ever." The stormy indignation
of the earlier verses passes away into
calm peace and patient waiting in praise and
trust:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"I will praise Thee for ever, for Thou hast done (it),</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">And wait on Thy name in the presence of Thy beloved, for it is good."</span></p>

<p>Hunted from Nob, David with a small company
struck across the country in a southwesterly
direction, keeping to the safety of the
tangled mountains, till, from the western side
of the hills of Judah, he looked down upon the
broad green plain of Philistia. Behind him was a
mad tyrant, in front the uncircumcised enemies
of his country and his God. His condition was
desperate, and he had recourse to desperate
measures. That nearest Philistine city, some
ten miles off, on which he looked down from
his height, was Gath; the glen where he had
killed its champion was close beside him,&mdash;every
foot of ground was familiar by many a
foray and many a fight. It was a dangerous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
resource to trust himself in Gath, with Goliath's
sword dangling in his belt. But he may have
hoped that he was not known by person, or
may have thought that Saul's famous commander
would be a welcome guest, as a banished
man, at the Philistine court. So he made the
plunge, and took refuge in Goliath's city. Discovery
soon came, and in the most ominous
form. It was an ugly sign that the servants
of Achish should be quoting the words of the
chant of victory which extolled him as the
slayer of their countryman. Vengeance for his
death was but too likely to come next. The
doubts of his identity seem to have lasted for
some little time, and to have been at first
privately communicated to the king. They
somehow reached David, and awoke his watchful
attention, as well as his fear. The depth
of his alarm and his ready resource are shown
by his degrading trick of assumed madness&mdash;certainly
the least heroic action of his life.
What a picture of a furious madman is the
description of his conduct when Achish's servants
came to arrest him. He "twisted himself
about in their hands" in the feigned contortions
of possession; he drummed on the leaves of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
the gate,<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> and "let his spittle run down into
his beard." (1 Sam. xxi. 13.) Israelitish quickness
gets the better of Philistine stupidity, as
it had been used to do from Sampson's time
onwards, and the dull-witted king falls into the
trap, and laughs away the suspicions with a
clumsy joke at his servants' expense about
more madmen being the last thing he was
short of. A hasty flight from Philistine territory
ended this episode.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_H_8" id="Footnote_H_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_H_8"><span class="label">[H]</span></a> The Septuagint appears to have followed a different reading
here from that of our present Hebrew text, and the change
adds a very picturesque clause to the description. A madman
would be more likely to hammer than to "scrabble" on the
great double-leaved gate.</p></div>

<p>The fifty-sixth psalm, which is referred by its
title to this period, seems at first sight to be in
strange contrast with the impressions drawn
from the narrative, but on a closer examination
is found to confirm the correctness of the reference
by its contents. The terrified fugitive, owing
his safety to a trick, and slavering like an idiot
in the hands of his rude captors, had an inner
life of trust strong enough to hold his mortal
terror in check, though not to annihilate it.
The psalm is far in advance of the conduct&mdash;is
it so unusual a circumstance as to occasion sur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>prise,
that lofty and sincere utterances of faith
and submission should co-exist with the opposite
feelings? Instead of taking the contrast
between the words and the acts as a proof that
this psalm is wrongly ascribed to the period in
question, let us rather be thankful for another
instance that imperfect faith may be genuine,
and that if we cannot rise to the height of unwavering
fortitude, God accepts a tremulous
trust fighting against mortal terror, and grasping
with a feeble hand the word of God, and the
memory of all his past deliverances. It is precisely
this conflict of faith and fear which the
psalm sets before us. It falls into three portions,
the first and second of which are closed by a
kind of refrain (vers. 4, 10, 11)&mdash;a structure
which is characteristic of several of these
Sauline persecution psalms (<i>e.g.</i>, lvii. 5, 11; lix.
9, 17). The first part of each of these two
portions is a vivid description of his danger,
from which he rises to the faith expressed in
the closing words. The repetition of the same
thoughts in both is not to be regarded as a cold
artifice of composition, but as the true expression
of the current of his thoughts. He sees his
enemies about him, ready to swallow him up&mdash;"there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
be many fighting against me disdainfully"<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>
(ver. 2). Whilst the terror creeps round
his heart ("he was sore afraid," 1 Sam. xxi. 12),
he rouses himself to trust, as he says, in words
which express most emphatically the co-existence
of the two, and carry a precious lesson of the
reality of even an interrupted faith, streaked with
many a black line of doubt and dread.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_I_9" id="Footnote_I_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_I_9"><span class="label">[I]</span></a> Literally, "loftily." Can there be any allusion to the giant
stature of Goliath's relations in Gath? We hear of four men
"born to the giant in Gath," who were killed in David's wars.
(2 Sam. xxi. 22.)</p></div>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"(In) the day (that) I am afraid&mdash;I trust on Thee."</span></p>

<p>And then he breaks into the utterance of praise
and confidence&mdash;to which he has climbed by the
ladder of prayer.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"In God I praise His word,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">In God I trust, I do not fear:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">What shall flesh do to me?"</span></p>

<p>How profoundly these words set forth the
object of his trust, as being not merely the
promise of God&mdash;which in David's case may be
the specific promise conveyed by his designation
to the throne&mdash;but the God who promises, the
inmost nature of that confidence as being a
living union with God, the power of it as grapp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>ling
with his dread, and enabling him now to
say, "I do <i>not</i> fear."</p>

<p>But again he falls from this height; another
surge of fear breaks over him, and almost washes
him from his rock. His foes, with ceaseless
malice, arrest his words; they skulk in ambush,
they dog his heels, they long for his life. The
crowded clauses portray the extremity of the
peril and the singer's agitation. His soul is still
heaving with the ground swell of the storm,
though the blasts come more fitfully, and are
dying into calm. He is not so afraid but that
he can turn to God; he turns to Him because
he is afraid, like the disciples in later days, who
had so much of terror that they must awake
their Master, but so much of trust that His
awaking was enough. He pleads with God, as
in former psalms, against his enemies, in words
which go far beyond the occasion, and connect
his own deliverance with the judgments of God
over the whole earth. He plaintively recalls his
homelessness and his sorrows in words which
exhibit the characteristic blending of hope and
pain, and which are beautifully in accordance
with the date assigned to the psalm. "My
wanderings dost Thou, even Thou, number."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
He is not alone in these weary flights from
Gibeah to Ramah, from Ramah to Nob, from
Nob to Gath, from Gath he knows not whither.
One friend goes with him through them all.
And as the water-skin was a necessary part of
a traveller's equipment, the mention of his wanderings
suggests the bold and tender metaphor
of the next clause, "Put my tears in Thy bottle,"&mdash;a
prayer for that very remembrance of his
sorrows, in the existence of which he immediately
declares his confidence&mdash;"Are they not in
Thy book?" The true office of faithful communion
with God is to ask for, and to appropriate,
the blessings which in the very act become
ours. He knows that his cry will scatter his
foes, for God is for him. And thus once again
he has risen to the height of confidence where
for a moment his feet have been already planted,
and again&mdash;but this time with even fuller
emphasis, expressed by an amplification which
introduces for the only time in the psalm the
mighty covenant name&mdash;he breaks into his
triumphant strain&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"In God I praise the Word;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">In JEHOVAH I praise the Word:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">In God I trust, I do not fear:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">What shall man do to me?"</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span></p>

<p>And from this mood of trustful expectation he
does not again decline. Prayer has brought its
chiefest blessing&mdash;the peace that passeth understanding.
The foe is lost to sight, the fear
conquered conclusively by faith; the psalm
which begins with a plaintive cry, ends in praise
for deliverance, as if it had been already
achieved&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"Thou hast delivered my life from death,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">(Hast Thou) not (delivered) my feet from falling,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">That I may walk before God in the light of the living?"</span></p>

<p>He already reckons himself safe; his question
is not an expression of doubt, but of assurance;
and he sees the purpose of all God's dealings
with him to be that the activities of life may all
be conducted in the happy consciousness of <i>His</i>
eye who is at once Guardian and Judge of His
children. How far above his fears and lies has
this hero and saint risen by the power of supplication
and the music of his psalm!</p>

<p>David naturally fled into Israelitish territory
from Gath. The exact locality of the cave
Adullam, where we next find him, is doubtful;
but several strong reasons occur for rejecting
the monkish tradition which places it away to
the east, in one of the wild wadies which run<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
down from Bethlehem to the Dead Sea. We
should expect it to be much more accessible by
a hasty march from Gath. Obviously it would
be convenient for him to hang about the frontier
of Philistia and Israel, that he might quickly
cross the line from one to the other, as dangers
appeared. Further, the city of Adullam is
frequently mentioned, and always in connections
which fix its site as on the margin of the great
plain of Philistia, and not far from Gath.
(2 Chron. xi. 7, etc.) There is no reason to
suppose that the cave of Adullam was in a
totally different district from the city. The
hills of Dan and Judah, which break sharply
down into the plain within a few miles of Gath,
are full of "extensive excavations," and there,
no doubt, we are to look for the rocky hold,
where he felt himself safer from pursuit, and
whence he could look down over the vast sweep
of the rich Philistine country. Gath lay at his
feet, close by was the valley where he had killed
Goliath, the scenes of Samson's exploits were
all about him. Thither fled to him his whole
family, from fear, no doubt, of Saul's revenge
falling on them; and there he gathers his band
of four hundred desperate men, whom poverty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
and misery, and probably the king's growing
tyranny, drove to flight. They were wild,
rough soldiers, according to the picturesque
description, "whose faces were like the faces of
lions, and were as swift as the roes upon the
mountains." They were not freebooters, but
seem to have acted as a kind of frontier-guard
against southern Bedouins and western Philistines
for the sheep-farmers of the border whom
Saul's government was too weak to protect.
In this desultory warfare, and in eluding the
pursuit of Saul, against whom it is to be observed
David never employed any weapon but flight,
several years were passed. The effect of such
life on his spiritual nature was to deepen his
unconditional dependence on God; by the
alternations of heat and cold, fear and hope,
danger and safety, to temper his soul and make
it flexible, tough and bright as steel. It evolved
the qualities of a leader of men; teaching him
command and forbearance, promptitude and
patience, valour and gentleness. It won for
him a name as the defender of the nation, as
Nabal's servant said of him and his men, "They
were a wall unto us, both by night and by day"
(1 Sam. xxv. 16). And it gathered round him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
a force of men devoted to him by the enthusiastic
attachment bred from long years of
common dangers, and the hearty friendships of
many a march by day, and nightly encampment
round the glimmering watchfires, beneath
the lucid stars.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h2 class="space"><a name="EXILE_3" id="EXILE_3"></a>VI.&mdash;THE EXILE&mdash;<span class="smcap"><i>continued</i>.</span></h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>

<p>We have one psalm which the title connects
with the beginning of David's
stay at Adullam,&mdash;the thirty-fourth. The supposition
that it dates from that period throws
great force into many parts of it, and gives a
unity to what is else apparently fragmentary
and disconnected. Unlike those already considered,
which were pure soliloquies, this is full
of exhortation and counsel, as would naturally
be the case if it were written when friends and
followers began to gather to his standard. It
reads like a long sigh of relief at escape from a
danger just past; its burden is to tell of God's
deliverance, and to urge to trust in Him. How
perfectly this tone corresponds to the circumstances
immediately after his escape from Gath
to Adullam need not be more than pointed out.
The dangers which he had dreaded and the cry
to God which he had sent forth are still present
to his mind, and echo through his song, like a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
subtly-touched chord of sadness, which appears
for a moment, and is drowned in the waves of
some triumphant music.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"I sought the Lord, and He heard me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">And from all my alarms He delivered me.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span style="margin-left:8.25em;">This afflicted (man) cried, and Jehovah heard,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">And from all his troubles He saved him."</span></p>

<p>And the "local colouring" of the psalm corresponds
too with the circumstances of Adullam.
How appropriate, for instance, does the form in
which the Divine protection is proclaimed become,
when we think of the little band bivouacking
among the cliffs, "The angel of the Lord
encampeth round about them that fear Him,
and delivereth them." Like his great ancestor,
he is met in his desert flight by heavenly guards,
"and he calls the name of that place Mahanaim"
(that is, "two camps"), as discerning gathered
round his own feeble company the ethereal
weapons of an encircling host of the warriors
of God, through whose impenetrable ranks his
foes must pierce before they can reach him.
From Samson's time we read of lions in this
district (Judges xiv. 8, 9), and we may recognise
another image as suggested by their growls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
heard among the ravines, and their gaunt forms
prowling near the cave. "The young lions do
lack and suffer hunger; but they that seek the
Lord shall not want any good" (ver. 10).</p>

<p>And then he passes to earnest instructions
and exhortations, which derive appositeness
from regarding them as a proclamation to his
men of the principles on which his camp is to
be governed. "Come, ye children, hearken
unto me." He regards himself as charged with
guiding them to godliness: "I will teach you
the fear of the Lord." With some remembrance,
perhaps, of his deception at Gath, he warns
them to "keep" their "tongues from evil" and
their "lips from speaking guile." They are not
to be in love with warfare, but, even with their
swords in their hands, are to "seek peace, and
pursue it." On these exhortations follow joyous
assurances of God's watchful eye fixed upon
the righteous, and His ear open to their cry; of
deliverance for his suppliants, whatsoever hardship
and trouble they may have to wade through;
of a guardianship which "keepeth all the bones"
of the righteous, so that neither the blows of the
foe nor the perils of the crags should break them,&mdash;all
crowned with the contrast ever present to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
David's mind, and having a personal reference
to his enemies and to himself:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"Evil shall slay the wicked,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">And the haters of the righteous shall suffer penalty.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">Jehovah redeems the life of His servants,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">And no penalty shall any suffer who trust in Him."</span></p>

<p>Such were the counsels and teachings of the
young leader to his little band,&mdash;noble "general
orders" from a commander at the beginning of
a campaign!</p>

<p>We venture to refer the twenty-seventh psalm
also to this period. It is generally supposed,
indeed, by those commentators who admit its
Davidic authorship, to belong to the time of
Absalom's rebellion. The main reason for
throwing it so late is the reference in ver. 4 to
dwelling in the house of the Lord and inquiring
in His temple.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> This is supposed to require a
date subsequent to David's bringing up of the
ark to Jerusalem, and placing it in a temporary
sanctuary. But whilst longing for the sanctuary
is no doubt characteristic of the psalms of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
later wanderings, it is by no means necessary to
suppose that in the present case that desire,
which David represents as the longing of his
life, was a desire for mere bodily presence in a
material temple. Indeed, the very language
seems to forbid such an interpretation. Surely
the desire for an abode in the house of the Lord&mdash;which
was his one wish, which he longed to
have continuous throughout all the days of his
life, which was to surround him with a privacy
of protection in trouble, and to be as the
munitions of rocks about him&mdash;was something
else than a morbid desire for an impossible
seclusion in the tabernacle,&mdash;a desire fitter for
some sickly medi&aelig;val monarch who buried his
foolish head and faint heart in a monastery than
for God's Anointed. We have seen an earlier
germ of the same desire in the twenty-third
psalm, the words of which are referred to here;
and the interpretation of the one is the interpretation
of the other. The psalmist breathes
his longing for the Divine fellowship, which
shall be at once vision, and guidance, and
hidden life in distress, and stability, and victory,
and shall break into music of perpetual praise.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_J_10" id="Footnote_J_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_J_10"><span class="label">[J]</span></a> "The fourth verse in its present form <i>must</i> have been
written after the temple was built."&mdash;"The Psalms chronologically
arranged," p. 68&mdash;following Ewald, in whose imperious
criticism that same naked "must have been," works
wonders.</p></div>

<p>If, then, we are not obliged by the words in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
question to adopt the later date, there is much
in the psalm which strikingly corresponds with
the earlier, and throws beautiful illustration on
the psalmist's mood at this period. One
such allusion we venture to suppose in the
words (ver. 2),</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"When the wicked came against me to devour my flesh,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">My enemies and my foes,&mdash;they stumbled and fell;"</span></p>

<p>which have been usually taken as a mere general
expression, without any allusion to a specific
event. But there was one incident in David's
life which had been forced upon his remembrance
by his recent peril at Gath&mdash;his duel with
Goliath, which exactly meets the very peculiar
language here. The psalm employs the same
word as the narrative, which tells how the
Philistine "arose, and came, and drew near to
David." The braggart boast, "I will give thy
flesh unto the fowls of the air and the beasts of
the fields," is echoed in the singular phrase of
the psalm; and the emphatic, rapid picture,
"they stumbled and fell," is at once a reminiscence
of the hour when the stone crashed
through the thick forehead, "and he fell upon
his face to the earth;" and also a reference to
an earlier triumph in Israel's history, celebrated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
with fierce exultation in the wild chant whom
rolls the words like a sweet morsel under the
tongue, as it tells of Sisera&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 8em;">"Between her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.25em;">Between her feet he bowed, he fell;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.25em;">Where he bowed, there he fell down dead."</span></p>

<p>Another autobiographical reference in the
psalm has been disputed on insufficient grounds:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 8em;">"For my father and my mother forsake me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.25em;">And Jehovah takes me up." (Ver. 10.)</span></p>

<p>It is, at all events, a remarkable coincidence
that the only mention of his parents after the
earliest chapters of his life falls in precisely with
this period of the history, and is such as might
have suggested these words. We read (1 Sam.
xxii. 3, 4) that he once ventured all the way
from Adullam to Moab to beg an asylum from
Saul's indiscriminate fury for his father and
mother, who were no doubt too old to share his
perils, as the rest of his family did. Having
prepared a kindly welcome for them, perhaps on
the strength of the blood of Ruth the Moabitess
in Jesse's veins, he returned to Bethlehem,
brought the old couple away, and guarded them
safely to their refuge. It is surely most natural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
to suppose that the psalm is the lyrical echo of
that event, and most pathetic to conceive of the
psalmist as thinking of the happy home at
Bethlehem now deserted, his brothers lurking
with him among the rocks, and his parents
exiles in heathen lands. Tears fill his eyes, but
he lifts them to a Father that is never parted
from him, and feels that he is no more orphaned
nor homeless.</p>

<p>The psalm is remarkable for the abrupt
transition of feeling which cleaves it into two
parts; one (vers. 1-6) full of jubilant hope and
enthusiastic faith, the other (vers. 7-14) a lowly
cry for help. There is no need to suppose, with
some critics, that we have here two independent
hymns bound together in error. He must have
little knowledge of the fluctuations of the devout
life who is surprised to find so swift a
passage from confidence to conscious weakness.
Whilst the usual order in the psalms, as the
usual order in good men's experience, is that
prayer for deliverance precedes praise and
triumph, true communion with God is bound
to no mechanical order, and may begin with
gazing on God, and realizing the mysteries of
beauty in His secret place, ere it drops to earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
The lark sings as it descends from the "privacy
of glorious light" to its nest in the stony furrows
as sweetly, though more plaintively, than whilst
it circles upwards to the sky. It is perhaps a
nobler effect of faith to begin with God and hymn
the victory as if already won, than to begin with
trouble and to call for deliverance. But with
whichever we commence, the prayer of earth must
include both; and so long as we are weak, and
God our strength, its elements must be "supplication
and thanksgiving." The prayer of our
psalm bends round again to its beginning, and
after the plaintive cry for help breaks once more
into confidence (vers. 13, 14). The psalmist
shudders as he thinks what ruin would have befallen
him if he had not trusted in God, and leaves
the unfinished sentence,&mdash;as a man looking
down into some fearful gulf starts back and
covers his eyes, before he has well seen the bottom
of the abyss.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"If I had not believed to see the goodness of the Lord</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:10.5em;">in the land of the living!"</span></p>

<p>Then rejoicing to remember how even by his
feeble trust he has been saved, he stirs up himself
to a firmer faith, in words which are them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>selves
an exercise of faith, as well as an incitement
to it:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"Wait on Jehovah!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">Courage! and let thy heart be strong!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">Yea! wait on Jehovah!"</span></p>

<p>Here is the true highest type of a troubled soul's
fellowship with God, when the black fear and
consciousness of weakness is inclosed in a golden
ring of happy trust. Let the name of our God
be first upon our lips, and the call to our wayward
hearts to wait on Him be last, and then we
may between think of our loneliness, and feebleness,
and foes, and fears, without losing our hold
of our Father's hand.</p>

<p>David in his rocky eyrie was joyful, because
he began with God. It was a man in real peril
who said, "The Lord is my light and my salvation,
whom shall I fear?" It was at a critical
pause in his fortunes, when he knew not yet
whether Saul's malice was implacable, that he
said, "Though war should rise against me, in
this will I be confident." It was in thankfulness
for the safe hiding-place among the dark
caverns of the hills that he celebrated the
dwelling of the soul in God with words coloured
by his circumstances, "In the secret of His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
tabernacle shall He hide me; He shall set me
up upon a rock." It was with Philistia at his
feet before and Saul's kingdom in arms behind
that his triumphant confidence was sure that
"Now shall mine head be lifted up above mine
enemies round about me." It was in weakness,
not expelled even by such joyous faith, that he
plaintively besought God's mercy, and laid
before His mercy-seat as the mightiest plea His
own inviting words, "Seek ye My face," and His
servant's humble response, "Thy face, Lord,
will I seek." Together, these made it impossible
that that Face, the beams of which are
light and salvation, should be averted. God's
past comes to his lips as a plea for a present
consistent with it and with His own mighty
name. "Thou hast been my help; leave me
not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation."
His loneliness, his ignorance of his road,
and the enemies who watch him, and, like a
later Saul, "breathe out cruelty" (see Acts ix. 1),
become to him in his believing petitions, not
grounds of fear, but arguments with God; and
having thus mastered all that was distressful in
his lot, by making it all the basis of his cry for
help, he rises again to hope, and stirs up him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>self
to lay hold on God, to be strong and bold,
because his expectation is from Him. A noble
picture of a steadfast soul; steadfast not because
of absence of fears and reasons for fear, but
because of presence of God and faith in Him.</p>

<p>Having abandoned Adullam, by the advice of
the prophet Gad, who from this time appears to
have been a companion till the end of his reign
(2 Sam. xxiv. 11), and who subsequently became
his biographer (1 Chron. xxix. 29), he
took refuge, as outlaws have ever been wont
to do, in the woods. In his forest retreat, somewhere
among the now treeless hills of Judah, he
heard of a plundering raid made by the Philistines
on one of the unhappy border towns.
The marauders had broken in upon the mirth
of the threshing-floors with the shout of battle,
and swept away the year's harvest. The
banished man resolved to strike a blow at
the ancestral foes. Perhaps one reason may
have been the wish to show that, outlaw as he
was, he, and not the morbid laggard at Gibeah,
who was only stirred to action by mad jealousy,
was the sword of Israel. The little band bursts
from the hills on the spoil-encumbered Philistines,
recaptures the cattle which like moss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
troopers they were driving homewards from the
ruined farmsteads, and routs them with great
slaughter. But the cowardly townspeople of
Keilah had less gratitude than fear; and the
king's banished son-in-law was too dangerous
a guest, even though he was of their own tribe,
and had delivered them from the enemy. Saul,
who had not stirred from his moody seclusion
to beat back invasion, summoned a hasty
muster, in the hope of catching David in the
little city, like a fox in his earth: and the
cowardly citizens meditated saving their homes
by surrendering their champion. David and
his six hundred saved themselves by a rapid
flight, and, as it would appear, by breaking up
into detachments. "They went whithersoever
they could go" (1 Sam. xxiii. 13); whilst David,
with some handful, made his way to the inhospitable
wilderness which stretches from the hills
of Judah to the shores of the Dead Sea, and
skulked there in "lurking places" among the
crags and tangled underwood. With fierce perseverance
"Saul sought him every day, but
God delivered him not into his hand." One
breath of love, fragrant and strength-giving, was
wafted to his fainting heart, when Jonathan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
found his way where Saul could not come, and
the two friends met once more. In the woodland
solitudes they plighted their faith again,
and the beautiful unselfishness of Jonathan is
wonderfully set forth in his words, "Thou shalt
be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto
thee;" while an awful glimpse is given into
that mystery of a godless will consciously
resisting the inevitable, when there is added,
"and that also Saul, my father, knoweth." In
such resistance the king's son has no part, for it
is pointedly noticed that he returned to his
house. Treachery, and that from the men of
his own tribe, again dogs David's steps. The
people of Ziph, a small place on the edge of
the southern desert, betray his haunt to Saul.
The king receives the intelligence with a burst
of thanks, in which furious jealousy and perverted
religion, and a sense of utter loneliness
and misery, and a strange self-pity, are mingled
most pathetically and terribly: "Blessed be ye
of the Lord, for ye have compassion on me!"
He sends them away to mark down his prey;
and when they have tracked him to his lair, he
follows with his force and posts them round the
hill where David and his handful lurk. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
little band try to escape, but they are surrounded
and apparently lost. At the very moment
when the trap is just going to close, a sudden
messenger, "fiery red with haste," rushes into
Saul's army with news of a formidable invasion:
"Haste thee and come; for the Philistines have
spread themselves upon the land!" So the
eager hand, ready to smite and crush, is plucked
back; and the hour of deepest distress is the
hour of deliverance.</p>

<p>At some period in this lowest ebb of David's
fortunes, we have one short psalm, very simple
and sad (liv.) It bears the title, "When the
Ziphims came and said to Saul, Doth not David
hide himself with us?" and may probably be
referred to the former of the two betrayals by
the men of Ziph. The very extremity of peril
has made the psalmist still and quiet. The sore
need has shortened his prayer. He is too sure
that God hears to use many words; for it is
distrust, not faith, which makes us besiege His
throne with much speaking. He is confident as
ever; but one feels that there is a certain self-restraint
and air of depression over the brief
petitions, which indicate the depth of his distress
and the uneasiness of protracted anxiety. Two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
notes only sound from his harp: one a plaintive
cry for help; the other, thanksgiving for deliverance
as already achieved. The two are bound
together by the recurrence in each of "the name"
of <span class="smcap">God</span>, which is at once the source of his salvation
and the theme of his praise. We have
only to read the lowly petitions to feel that
they speak of a spirit somewhat weighed down
by danger, and relaxed from the loftier mood of
triumphant trust.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 8em;">(1) O God, by Thy name save me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.35em;">And in Thy strength do judgment for me</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">(2) O God, hear my prayer,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.35em;">Give ear to the words of my mouth.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">(3) For strangers are risen against me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.3em;">And tyrants seek my life.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.35em;">They set not God before them.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The enemies are called "strangers;" but, as
we have seen in the first of these songs of the
exile, it is not necessary, therefore, to suppose
that they were not Israelites. The Ziphites
were men of Judah like himself; and there is
bitter emphasis as well as a gleam of insight
into the spiritual character of the true Israel in
calling them foreigners. The other name, oppressors,
or violent men, or, as we have rendered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
it, tyrants, corresponds too accurately with the
character of Saul in his later years, to leave
much doubt that it is pointed at him. If so,
the softening of the harsh description by the use
of the plural is in beautiful accordance with the
forgiving leniency which runs through all David's
conduct to him. Hard words about Saul himself
do not occur in the psalms. His counsellors,
his spies, the liars who calumniated David to
him, and for their own ends played upon his
suspicious nature,&mdash;the tools who took care that
the cruel designs suggested by themselves should
be carried out, kindle David's wrath, but it
scarcely ever lights on the unhappy monarch
whom he loved with all-enduring charity while
he lived, and mourned with magnificent eulogy
when he died. The allusion is made all the more
probable, because of the verbal correspondence
with the narrative which records that "Saul was
come out to seek his life" (1 Sam. xxiii. 15.)</p>

<p>A chord or two from the harp permits the
mind to dwell on the thought of the foes, and
prepares for the second part of this psalm. In
it thanksgiving and confidence flow from the
petitions of the former portion. But the praise
is not so jubilant, nor the trust so victorious,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
as we have seen them. "The peace of God"
has come in answer to prayer, but it is somewhat
subdued:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"Behold, God is my helper;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.35em;">The Lord is the supporter of my life."</span></p>

<p>The foes sought his life, but, as the historical
book gives the antithesis, "Saul sought him
every day, but God delivered him not into his
hand." The rendering of the English version,
"The Lord is with them that uphold my soul,"
is literally accurate, but does not convey the
meaning of the Hebrew idiom. God is not
regarded as one among many helpers, but as
alone the supporter or upholder of his life.
Believing that, the psalmist, of course, believes
as a consequence that his enemies will be
smitten with evil for their evil. The prophetic
lip of faith calls things that are not as though
they were. In the midst of his dangers he looks
forward to songs of deliverance and glad sacrifices
of praise; and the psalm closes with words
that approach the more fervid utterances we
have already heard, as if his song had raised his
own spirit above its fears:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">(6) With willinghood will I sacrifice unto Thee.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.55em;">I will praise Thy name for it is good.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">(7) For from all distress it has delivered me.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">And on my enemies will mine eye see (my desire)</span></p>

<p>The name&mdash;the revealed character of God&mdash;was
the storehouse of all the saving energies to
which he appealed in verse 1. It is the theme
of his praise when the deliverance shall have
come. It is almost regarded here as equivalent
to the Divine personality&mdash;it is good, <i>it</i> has
delivered him. Thus, we may say that this
brief psalm gives us as the single thought of a
devout soul in trouble, the name of the Lord,
and teaches by its simple pathos how the contemplation
of God as He has made Himself
known, should underlie every cry for help and
crown every thanksgiving; whilst it may assure
us that whosoever seeks for the salvation of that
mighty name may, even in the midst of trouble,
rejoice as in an accomplished deliverance. And
all such thoughts should be held with a faith at
least as firm as the ancient psalmist's, by us to
whom the "name" of the Lord is "declared"
by Him who is the full revelation of God, and
the storehouse of all blessings and help to his
"brethren." (Heb. ii. 12.)</p>

<p>A little plain of some mile or so in breadth
slopes gently down towards the Dead Sea about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span>
the centre of its western shore. It is girdled
round by savage cliffs, which, on the northern
side, jut out in a bold headland to the water's
edge. At either extremity is a stream flowing
down a deep glen choked with luxurious vegetation;
great fig-trees, canes, and maiden-hair
ferns covering the rocks. High up on the hills
forming its western boundary a fountain sparkles
into light, and falls to the flat below in long
slender threads. Some grey weathered stones
mark the site of a city that was old when
Abraham wandered in the land. Traces of the
palm forests which, as its name indicates, were
cleared for its site (Hazezon Tamar, The palm-tree
clearing) have been found, encrusted with
limestone, in the warm, damp gullies, and ruined
terraces for vineyards can be traced on the bare
hill-sides. But the fertility of David's time is
gone, and the precious streams nourish only a
jungle haunted by leopard and ibex. This is
the fountain and plain of Engedi (the fount of
the wild goat), a spot which wants but industry
and care to make it a little paradise. Here
David fled from the neighbouring wilderness,
attracted no doubt by the safety of the deep
gorges and rugged hills, as well as by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
abundance of water in the fountain and the
streams. The picturesque and touching episode
of his meeting with Saul has made the place
for ever memorable. There are many excavations
in the rocks about the fountain, which may
have been the cave&mdash;black as night to one looking
inward with eyes fresh from the blinding
glare of sunlight upon limestone, but holding a
glimmering twilight to one looking outwards with
eyes accustomed to the gloom&mdash;in the innermost
recesses of which David lay hid while Saul tarried
in its mouth. The narrative gives a graphic
picture of the hurried colloquy among the little
band, when summary revenge was thus unexpectedly
put within their grasp. The fierce retainers
whispered their suggestion that it would
be "tempting providence" to let such an opportunity
escape; but the nobler nature of David
knows no personal animosity, and in these
earliest days is flecked by no cruelty nor lust of
blood. He cannot, however, resist the temptation
of showing his power and almost parading
his forbearance by stealing through the darkness
and cutting away the end of Saul's long
robe. It was little compared with what he
could as easily have done&mdash;smite him to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
heart as he crouched there defenceless. But it
was a coarse practical jest, conveying a rude insult,
and the quickly returning nobleness of his
nature made him ashamed of it, as soon as he
had clambered back with his trophy. He felt
that the sanctity of Saul's office as the anointed
of the Lord should have saved him from the
gibe. The king goes his way all unawares, and,
as it would seem, had not regained his men,
when David, leaving his band (very much out of
temper no doubt at his foolish nicety), yields to
a gush of ancient friendship and calls loudly
after him, risking discovery and capture in his
generous emotion. The pathetic conversation
which ensued is eminently characteristic of
both men, so tragically connected and born to
work woe to one another. David's remonstrance
(1 Sam. xxiv. 9-15) is full of nobleness, of
wounded affection surviving still, of conscious
rectitude, of solemn devout appeal to the judgment
of God. He has no words of reproach
for Saul, no weak upbraidings, no sullen anger,
no repaying hate with hate. He almost pleads
with the unhappy king, and yet there is nothing
undignified or feeble in his tone. The whole is
full of correspondences, often of verbal identity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
with the psalms which we assign to this period.
The calumnies which he so often complains of
in these are the subject of his first words to
Saul, whom he regards as having had his heart
poisoned by lies: "Wherefore hearest thou
men's words, saying, Behold! David seeketh
thy hurt." He asserts absolute innocence of
anything that warranted the king's hostility,
just as he does so decisively in the psalms.
"There is neither evil nor transgression in my
hand, and I have not sinned against thee." As
in them he so often compares himself to some
wild creature pursued like the goats in the cliffs
of Engedi, so he tells Saul, "Thou huntest my
life to take it." And his appeal from earth's
slanders, and misconceptions, and cruelties, to
the perfect tribunal of God, is couched in language,
every clause of which may be found in
his psalms. "The Lord, therefore, be judge,
and judge between me and thee, and see, and
plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy
hand."</p>

<p>The unhappy Saul again breaks into a passion
of tears. With that sudden flashing out into
vehement emotion so characteristic of him, and
so significant of his enfeebled self-control, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
recognises David's generous forbearance and its
contrast to his own conduct. For a moment, at
all events, he sees, as by a lightning flash, the
mad hopelessness of the black road he is treading
in resisting the decree that has made his
rival king&mdash;and he binds him by an oath to
spare his house when he sits on the throne. The
picture moves awful thoughts and gentle pity
for the poor scathed soul writhing in its hopelessness
and dwelling in a great solitude of fear,
but out of which stray gleams of ancient nobleness
still break;&mdash;and so the doomed man goes
back to his gloomy seclusion at Gibeah, and
David to the free life of the mountains and the
wilderness.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>

<p>There are many echoes of this period of
Engedi in the Psalms. Perhaps the most
distinctly audible of these are to be found in
the seventh psalm, which is all but universally
recognised as David's, even Ewald concurring
in the general consent. It is an irregular ode&mdash;for
such is the meaning of Shiggaion in the
title, and by its broken rhythms and abrupt
transitions testifies to the emotion of its author.
The occasion of it is said to be "the words of
Cush the Benjamite." As this is a peculiar
name for an Israelite, it has been supposed to
be an allegorical designation for some historical
person, expressive of his character. We might
render it "the negro." The Jewish commentators
have taken it to refer to Saul himself,
but the bitter tone of the psalm, so unlike
David's lingering forbearance to the man whom
he never ceased to love, is against that supposition.
Shimei the Benjamite, whose foul tongue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
cursed him in rabid rage, as he fled before
Absalom, has also been thought of, but the
points of correspondence with the earlier date
are too numerous to make that reference tenable.
It seems better to suppose that Cush "the
black" was one of Saul's tribe, who had been
conspicuous among the calumniators of whom
we have seen David complaining to the king.
And if so, there is no period in the Sauline persecution
into which the psalm will fit so naturally
as the present. Its main thoughts are precisely
those which he poured out so passionately in
his eager appeal when he and Saul stood face
to face on the solitary hill side. They are
couched in the higher strain of poetry indeed,
but that is the only difference; whilst there are
several verbal coincidences, and at least one
reference to the story, which seem to fix the
date with considerable certainty.</p>

<p>In it we see the psalmist's soul surging with
the ground swell of strong emotion, which
breaks into successive waves of varied feeling&mdash;first
(vers. 1, 2) terror blended with trust, the
enemy pictured, as so frequently in these early
psalms, as a lion who tears the flesh and breaks
the bones of his prey&mdash;and the refuge in God<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
described by a graphic word very frequent also
in the cotemporaneous psalms (xi. 1; lvii. 1, etc.).
Then with a quick turn comes the passionate
protestation of his innocence, in hurried words,
broken by feeling, and indignantly turning
away from the slanders which he will not speak
of more definitely than calling them "this."</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">(3) Jehovah, my God! if I have done this&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.35em;">If there be iniquity in my hands&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left:8em;">(4) If I have rewarded evil to him that was at peace with me&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.35em;">Yea, I delivered him that without cause is mine enemy&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left:8em;">(5) May the enemy pursue my soul and capture it,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.35em;">And trample down to the earth my life,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.35em;">And my glory in the dust may he lay!</span></p>

<p>How remarkably all this agrees with his
words to Saul, "There is neither evil nor transgression
in my hand, ... yet thou huntest
my soul to take it" (1 Sam. xxiv. 11); and how
forcible becomes the singular reiteration in the
narrative, of the phrase "my hand," which
occurs six times in four verses. The peculiarly
abrupt introduction in ver. 4 of the clause, "I
delivered him that without cause is mine enemy,"
which completely dislocates the grammatical
structure, is best accounted for by supposing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>
that David's mind is still full of the temptation
to stain his hands with Saul's blood, and is
vividly conscious of the effort which he had had
to make to overcome it. And the solemn
invocation of destruction which he dares to
address to Jehovah his God includes the familiar
figure of himself as a fugitive before the hunters,
which is found in the words already quoted,
and which here as there stands in immediate
connection with his assertion of clean hands.</p>

<p>Then follows, with another abrupt turn, a
vehement cry to God to judge his cause; his
own individual case melts into the thought of a
world-wide judgment, which is painted with
grand power with three or four broad rapid
strokes.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">(6) Awake for me&mdash;Thou hast commanded judgment.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left:8em;">(7) Let the assembly of the nations stand round Thee,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.35em;">And above it return Thou up on high.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left:8em;">(8) Jehovah will judge the nations.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.35em;">Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness and mine integrity in</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">me!</span></p>

<p>Each smaller act of God's judgment is connected
with the final world-judgment, is a prophecy
of it, is one in principle therewith; and
He, who at the last will be known as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>
universal Judge of all, certainly cannot leave
His servants' cause unredressed nor their cry
unheard till then. The psalmist is led by his
own history to realize more intensely that truth
of a Divine manifestation for judicial purposes
to the whole world, and his prophetic lip paints
its solemnities as the surest pledge of his own
deliverance. He sees the gathered nations
standing hushed before the Judge, and the
Victor God at the close of the solemn act
ascending up on high where He was before,
above the heads of the mighty crowd (Psalm
lxviii. 19). In the faith of this vision, and
because God will judge the nations, he invokes
for himself the anticipation of that final triumph
of good over evil, and asks to be dealt with
according to his righteousness. Nothing but
the most hopeless determination to find difficulties
could make a difficulty of such words.
David is not speaking of his whole character
or life, but of his conduct in one specific matter,
namely, in his relation to Saul. The righteous
integrity which he calls God to vindicate is
not general sinlessness nor inward conformity
with the law of God, but his blamelessness in
all his conduct to his gratuitous foe. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>
prayer that God would judge him is distinctly
equivalent to his often repeated cry for deliverance,
which should, as by a Divine arbitration,
decide the debate between Saul and him.
The whole passage in the psalm, with all its
lyrical abruptness and lofty imagery, is the expression
of the very same thought which we
find so prominent in his words to Saul, already
quoted, concerning God's judging between them
and delivering David out of Saul's hand. The
parallel is instructive, not only as the prose
rendering of the poetry in the psalm, explaining
it beyond the possibility of misunderstanding,
but also as strongly confirmatory of the date
which we have assigned to the latter. It is so
improbable as to be almost inconceivable that
the abrupt disconnected themes of the psalm
should echo so precisely the <i>whole</i> of the arguments
used in the remonstrance of the historical
books, and should besides present verbal resemblances
and historical allusions to these,
unless it be of the same period, and therefore
an inlet into the mind of the fugitive as he
lurked among the rugged cliffs by "the fountain
of the wild goat."</p>

<p>In that aspect the remainder of the psalm is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
very striking and significant. We have two
main thoughts in it&mdash;that of God as punishing
evil in this life, and that of the self-destruction
inherent in all sin; and these are expressed with
such extraordinary energy as to attest at once
the profound emotion of the psalmist, and his
familiarity with such ideas during his days of
persecution. It is noticeable, too, that the
language is carefully divested of all personal
reference; he has risen to the contemplation of
a great law of the Divine government, and at
that elevation the enemies whose calumnies and
cruelties had driven him to God fade into insignificance.</p>

<p>With what magnificent boldness he paints
God the Judge arraying Himself in His armour
of destruction!</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">(11) God is a righteous Judge,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.85em;">And a God (who is) angry every day.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left:8em;">(12) If he (<i>i.e.</i>, the evil-doer) turn not, He whets His sword,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.85em;">His bow He has bent, and made it ready.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left:8em;">(13) And for him He has prepared weapons of death,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.85em;">His arrows He has made blazing darts.</span></p>

<p>Surely there is nothing grander in any poetry
than this tremendous image, smitten out with so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
few strokes of the chisel, and as true as it is
grand. The representation applies to the facts
of life, of which as directed by a present Providence,
and not of any future retribution, David
is here thinking. Among these facts is chastisement
falling upon obstinate antagonism to God.
Modern ways of thinking shrink from such representations;
but the whole history of the
world teems with confirmation of their truth&mdash;only
what David calls the flaming arrows of
God, men call "the natural consequences of
evil." The later revelation of God in Christ
brings into greater prominence the disciplinary
character of all punishment here, but bates no
jot of the intensity with which the earlier revelation
grasped the truth of God as a righteous
Judge in eternal opposition to, and aversion
from, evil.</p>

<p>With that solemn picture flaming before his
inward eye, the prophet-psalmist turns to gaze
on the evil-doer who has to bear the brunt of
these weapons of light. Summoning us to look
with him by a "Behold!" he tells his fate in an
image of frequent occurrence in the psalms of
this period, and very natural in the lips of a
man wandering in the desert among wild<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
creatures, and stumbling sometimes into the
traps dug for them: "He has dug a hole and
hollowed it out, and he falls into the pitfall he
is making." The crumbling soil in which he
digs makes his footing on the edge more precarious
with every spadeful that he throws out,
and at last, while he is hard at work, in he
tumbles. It is the conviction spoken in the
proverbs of all nations, expressed here by David
in a figure drawn from life&mdash;the conviction that
all sin digs its own grave and is self-destructive.
The psalm does not proclaim the yet deeper
truth that this automatic action, by which sin
sets in motion its own punishment, has a disciplinary
purpose, so that the arrows of God
wound for healing, and His armour is really
girded on for, even while it seems to be against,
the sufferer. But it would not be difficult to
show that that truth underlies the whole Old
Testament doctrine of retribution, and is obvious
in many of David's psalms. In the present one
the deliverance of the hunted prey is contemplated
as the end of the baffled trapper's fall
into his own snare, and beyond that the
psalmist's thoughts do not travel. His own
safety, the certainty that his appeal to God's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>
judgment will not be in vain, fill his mind;
and without following the fate of his enemy
further, he closes this song of tumultuous and
varied emotion with calm confidence and a vow
of thanksgiving for a deliverance which is already
as good as accomplished:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">(17) I will give thanks to Jehovah according to His righteousness,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.85em;">And I will sing the name of Jehovah, Most High.</span></p>

<p>We have still another psalm (lvii.) which is
perhaps best referred to this period. According
to the title, it belongs to the time when David
"fled from Saul in the cave." This may, of
course, apply to either Adullam or Engedi, and
there is nothing decisive to be alleged for
either; yet one or two resemblances to psalm
vii. incline the balance to the latter period.</p>

<p>These resemblances are the designation of
his enemies as lions (vii. 2; lvii. 4); the image
of their falling into their own trap (vii. 15; lvii.
6); the use of the phrase "my honour" or
"glory" for "my soul" (vii. 5; lvii. 8&mdash;the same
word in the original); the name of God as
"Most High" (vii. 17; lvii. 2), an expression
which only occurs twice besides in the Davidic
psalms (ix. 2; xxi. 7); the parallelism in sense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
between the petition which forms the centre and
the close of the one, "Be Thou exalted, O God,
above the heavens" (lvii. 5, 11), and that which
is the most emphatic desire of the other,
"Arise, O Lord, awake, ... lift up Thyself for
me" (vii. 6). Another correspondence, not preserved
in our English version, is the employment
in both of a rare poetical word, which originally
means "to complete," and so comes naturally
to have the secondary significations of "to perfect"
and "to put an end to." The word in
question only occurs five times in the Old Testament,
and always in psalms. Four of these are
in hymns ascribed to David, of which two are
(lvii. 2), "The God that <i>performeth</i> all things
for me," and (vii. 9), "Let the wickedness of the
wicked <i>come to an end</i>." The use of the same
peculiar word in two such dissimilar connections
seems to show that it was, as we say, "running
in his head" at the time, and is, perhaps, a
stronger presumption of the cotemporaneousness
of both psalms than its employment in both
with the same application would have been.</p>

<p>Characteristic of these early psalms is the occurrence
of a refrain (compare lvi. and lix.)
which in the present instance closes both of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
portions of which the hymn consists. The
former of these (1-5) breathes prayerful trust,
from which it passes to describe the encompassing
dangers; the second reverses this order, and
beginning with the dangers and distress, rises
to ringing gladness and triumph, as though the
victory were already won. The psalmist's confident
cleaving of soul to God is expressed (ver.
1) by an image that may be connected with his
circumstances at Engedi: "In Thee has my
soul taken refuge." The English version is
correct as regards the sense, though it obliterates
the beautiful metaphor by its rendering
"trusteth." The literal meaning of the verb is
"to flee to a refuge," and its employment here
may be due to the poetical play of the imagination,
which likens his secure retreat among the
everlasting hills to the safe hiding-place which
his spirit found in God his habitation. A
similar analogy appears in the earliest use of
the expression, which may have been floating
in the psalmist's memory, and which occurs in
the ancient song of Moses (Deut. xxxii.). The
scenery of the forty years' wanderings remarkably
colours that ode, and explains the frequent
recurrence in it of the name of God as "the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
Rock." We have false gods, too, spoken of in
it, as, "Their rock in whom they took refuge,"
where the metaphor appears in its completeness
(ver. 37). Our psalm goes on with words which
contain a further allusion to another part of the
same venerable hymn, "And in the shadow of
Thy wings will I take refuge," which remind
us of the grand image in it of God's care over
Israel, as of the eagle bearing her eaglets on her
mighty pinions (ver. 11), and point onwards to
the still more wonderful saying in which all that
was terrible and stern in the older figure is
softened into tenderness, and instead of the
fierce affection of the mother eagle, the hen
gathering her chickens under her wings becomes
the type of the brooding love and more than
maternal solicitude of God in Christ. Nor can
we forget that the only other instance of the
figure before David's psalms is in the exquisite
idyl which tells of the sweet heroism of David's
ancestress, Ruth, on whose gentle and homeless
head was pronounced the benediction, "A full
reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel,
under whose wings thou art come to trust"
(Ruth ii. 12). We may perhaps also see in this
clause an extension of the simile which unquestionably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
lies in the verb, and may think of the
strong "sides of the cave," arching above the
fugitive like a gigantic pair of wings beneath
which he nestles warm and dry, while the short-lived
storm roars among the rocks&mdash;a type of
that broad pinion which is his true defence till
threatening evils be overpast. In the past he
has sheltered his soul in God, but no past act of
faith can avail for present distresses. It must
be perpetually renewed. The past deliverances
should make the present confidence more easy;
and the true use of all earlier exercises of trust
is to prepare for the resolve that we will still
rely on the help we have so often proved. "I
have trusted in Thee" should ever be followed
by "And in the shadow of Thy wings will I
trust."</p>

<p>The psalmist goes on to fulfil his resolve.
He takes refuge by prayer in God, whose absolute
elevation above all creatures and circumstances
is the ground of his hope, whose faithful
might will accomplish its design, and complete
His servant's lot. "I will call to God
Most High; to God who perfects (His purpose)
for me." And then assured hope gleams upon
his soul, and though the storm-clouds hang low<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
and black as ever, they are touched with light.
"He will send from heaven and save me." But
even while this happy certainty dawns upon
him, the contending fears, which ever lurk hard
by faith, reassert their power, and burst in,
breaking the flow of the sentence, which by its
harsh construction indicates the sudden irruption
of disturbing thoughts. "He that would
swallow me up reproaches (me)." With this
two-worded cry of pain&mdash;prolonged by the very
unusual occurrence, in the middle of a verse, of
the "Selah," which is probably a musical direction
for the accompaniment&mdash;a billow of terror
breaks over his soul; but its force is soon spent,
and the hope, above which for a moment it had
rolled, rises from the broken spray like some
pillared light round which the surges dash in
vain. "God shall send forth His mercy and
His truth"&mdash;those two white-robed messengers
who draw nigh to all who call on Him. Then
follows in broken words, the true rendering of
which is matter of considerable doubt, a renewed
picture of his danger:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8.5em;">(4) (With) my soul&mdash;among lions will I lie down.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.85em;">Devourers are the sons of men;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.85em;">Their teeth a spear and arrows,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.85em;">And their tongue a sharp sword</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span></p>

<p>The psalmist seems to have broken off the
construction, and instead of finishing the sentence
as he began it, to have substituted the
first person for the third, which ought to have
followed "my soul." This fragmentary construction
expresses agitation of spirit. It may
be a question whether the "lions" in the first
clause are to be regarded as a description of his
enemies, who are next spoken of without metaphor
as sons of men who devour (or who
"breathe out fire"), and whose words are cutting
and wounding as spear and sword. The analogy
of the other psalms of this period favours such
an understanding of the words. But, on the
other hand, the reference preferred by Delitzsch
and others gives great beauty. According to
that interpretation, the fugitive among the
savage cliffs prepares himself for his nightly
slumbers in calm confidence, and lays himself
down there in the cave, while the wild beasts,
whose haunt it may have been, prowl without,
feeling himself safer among them than among
the more ferocious "sons of men," whose hatred
has a sharper tooth than even theirs. And then
this portion of the psalm closes with the refrain,
"Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>
let Thy glory be above all the earth." A
prayer that God would show forth His power,
and exalt His name by delivering His servant.
What lofty conviction that his cause was God's
cause, that the Divine honour was concerned in
his safety, that he was a chosen instrument to
make known God's praise over all the world!&mdash;and
what self-forgetfulness in that, even
whilst he prays for his own deliverance, he
thinks of it rather as the magnifying of God,
than as it affects himself personally!</p>

<p>The second part continues the closing strain
of the former, and describes the plots of his foes
in the familiar metaphor of the pit, into which
they fall themselves. The contemplation of
this divine Nemesis on evil-doers leads up to
the grand burst of thanksgiving with which the
psalm closes&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">(7) Fixed is my heart, O God! fixed my heart!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">I will sing and strike the harp.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></span><br />

which is very obscure.</p></div>

<p>If the former part may be regarded as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>
evening song of confidence, this is the morning
hymn of thankfulness. He lay down in peace
among lions; he awakes to praise. He calls upon
his soul to shake off slumber; he invokes the
chords of his harp to arouse from its chamber
the sleeping dawn. Like a mightier than himself,
he will rise a great while before day, and
the clear notes of the rude lyre, his companion
in all his wanderings, will summon the morning
to add its silent speech to His praise. But a
still loftier thought inspires him. This hunted
solitary not only knows that his deliverance is
certain, but he has already the consciousness of
a world-wide vocation, and anticipates that the
story of his sorrow and his trust, with the music
of his psalms, belong to the world, and will flow
over the barriers of his own generation and of
his own land into the whole earth&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">(9) I will praise Thee among the peoples, O Lord,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.85em;">I will strike the harp to Thee among the nations.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left:8em;">(10) For great unto the heavens is Thy mercy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.85em;">And to the clouds Thy truth.</span><br />
</p>

<p>These two mighty messengers of God, whose
coming he was sure of (ver. 3), will show themselves
in his deliverance, boundless and filling
all the creation. They shall be the theme of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
world-wide praise. And then with the repetition
of the refrain the psalm comes round again
to supplication, and dies into silent waiting
before God till He shall be pleased to answer.
Thus triumphant were the hopes of the lonely
fugitive skulking in the wilderness; such bright
visions peopled the waste places, and made the
desert to rejoice and blossom as the rose.</p>

<p>The cxlii. is also, according to the title, one
of the cave-psalms. But considerable doubt
attaches to the whole group of so-called Davidic
compositions in the last book of the psalter
(p. 138-144), from their place, and from the fact
that there are just seven of them, as well as in
some cases from their style and character.
They are more probably later hymns in David's
manner. The one in question corresponds in
tone with the psalms which we have been considering.
It breathes the same profound consciousness
of desolation and loneliness: "My
spirit is darkened within me;" "Refuge fails
me, no man cares for my soul." It glows with
the same ardour of personal trust in and love to
God which spring from his very loneliness and
helplessness: "I cry unto Thee, O Jehovah! I
say Thou art my refuge and my portion in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>
land of the living." It triumphs with the same
confidence, and with the same conviction that
his deliverance concerns all the righteous:
"They shall <i>crown themselves in me</i>, for Thou
hast dealt bountifully with me;" for such would
appear to be the true meaning of the word
rendered in our version "compass me about;"
the idea being that the mercy of God to the
psalmist would become a source of festal gladness
to all His servants, who would bind the
story of God's bounty to him upon their brows
like a coronal for a banquet.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<hr />

<h2 class="space"><a name="EXILE_5" id="EXILE_5"></a>VIII.&mdash;THE EXILE&mdash;<span class="smcap"><i>continued</i>.</span></h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>

<p>As our purpose in this volume is not a complete
biography, it will not be necessary
to dwell on the subsequent portions of the exile,
inasmuch as there is little reference to these in
the psalms. We must pass over even that exquisite
episode of Abigail, whose graceful
presence and "most subtle flow of silver-paced
counsel" soothed David's ruffled spirit, and led
him captive at once as in a silken leash. The
glimpse of old-world ways in the story, the
rough mirth of the shearers, the hint of the kind
of black mail by which David's little force was
provided, the snarling humour and garrulous
crustiness of Nabal, David's fierce blaze of hot
wrath, the tribute of the shepherds to the kindliness
and honour of the outlaws, the rustic
procession, with the gracious lady last of all, the
stately courtesy of the meeting, her calm wise
words&mdash;not flattery, yet full of predictions of
prosperity most pleasant to hear from such lips;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>
not rebuke, yet setting in the strongest light
how unworthy of God's anointed personal vengeance
was; not servile, but yet recognising in
delicate touches his absolute power over her;
not abject, and yet full of supplication,&mdash;the
quick response of David's frank nature and
susceptible heart, which sweeps away all his
wrath; the budding germ of love, which makes
him break into benedictions on her and her
wisdom, and thankfulness that he had been kept
back from "hurting <i>thee</i>," and the dramatic
close in their happy union,&mdash;all make up one of
the most charming of the many wonderful idyls of
Scripture, all fragrant with the breath of love,
and fresh with undying youth. The story lives&mdash;alas!
how much longer do words endure than
the poor earthly affections which they record!</p>

<p>After a second betrayal by the men of Ziph,
and a second meeting with Saul&mdash;their last&mdash;in
which the doomed man parts from him with
blessing and predictions of victory on his unwilling
lips, David seems to have been driven to
desperation by his endless skulking in dens and
caves, and to have seen no hope of continuing
much longer to maintain himself on the frontier
and to elude Saul's vigilance. Possibly others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
than Nabal grudged to pay him for the volunteer
police which he kept up on behalf of the pastoral
districts exposed to the wild desert tribes. At
all events he once more made a plunge into
Philistine territory, and offers himself and his
men to the service of the King of Gath. On the
offer being accepted, the little town of Ziklag
was allotted to them, and became their home
for a year and four months.</p>

<p>To this period of comparative security one
psalm has been supposed to belong&mdash;the xxxi.,
which, in tone and in certain expressions, corresponds
very well with the circumstances. There
are many similarities in it with the others of the
same period which we have already considered&mdash;such,
for instance, as the figure of God his rock
(ver. 3), the net which his enemies have laid for
him (ver. 4), the allusions to their calumnies and
slanders (vers. 13, 18), his safe concealment in
God (ver. 20: compare xxvii. 5; lvii. 1; xvii. 8,
etc.), and the close verbal resemblance of ver. 24
with the closing words of psalm xxvii. The
reference, however, which has been taken as
pointing to David's position in Ziklag is that
contained in the somewhat remarkable words
(ver. 21): "Blessed be the Lord, for He hath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>
showed me His marvellous loving-kindness in a
strong city." Of course, the expression may be
purely a graphic figure for the walls and
defences of the Divine protection, as, indeed, it
is usually understood to be. But the general
idea of the encompassing shelter of God has just
been set forth in the magnificent imagery of the
previous verse as the tabernacle, the secret of
His presence in which He hides and guards His
servants. And the further language of the
phrase in question, introduced as it is by a
rapturous burst of blessing and praise, seems so
emphatic and peculiar as to make not unnatural
the supposition of a historical basis in some
event which had recently happened to the
psalmist.</p>

<p>No period of the life will so well correspond
to such a requirement as the sixteen months of
his stay in Ziklag, during which he was completely
free from fear of Saul, and stood high in
favour with the King of Gath, in whose territory
he had found a refuge. We may well believe
that to the hunted exile, so long accustomed to
a life of constant alarms and hurried flight, the
quiet of a settled home was very sweet, and
that behind the rude fortifications of the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>
town in the southern wilderness there seemed
security, which made a wonderful contrast to
their defenceless lairs and lurking-places among
the rocks. Their eyes would lose their watchful
restlessness, and it would be possible to lay aside
their weapons, to gather their households about
them, and, though they were in a foreign land,
still to feel something of the bliss of peaceful
habitudes and tranquil use and wont healing
their broken lives. No wonder, then, that such
thankful praise should break from the leader's
lips! No wonder that he should regard this
abode in a fortified city as the result of a miracle
of Divine mercy! He describes the tremulous
despondency which had preceded this marvel of
loving-kindness in language which at once
recalls the wave of hopelessness which swept
across his soul after his final interview with
Saul, and which led to his flight into Philistine
territory, "And David said in his heart, I shall
now perish one day by the hand of Saul"
(1 Sam. xxvii. 1). How completely this corresponds
with the psalm, allowance being made
for the difference between poetry and prose,
when he describes the thoughts which had
shaded his soul just before the happy peace of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>
the strong city&mdash;"I said in my haste,<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> I am cut
off from before Thine eyes; nevertheless Thou
heardest the voice of my supplication" (ver. 22).
And rising, as was ever his manner, from his
own individual experience to the great truths
concerning God's care of His children, the
discovery of which was to him even more precious
than his personal safety, he breaks forth
in jubilant invocation, which, as always, is
full of his consciousness that his life and his
story belong to the whole household of God&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">(23) O love Jehovah, all ye beloved of Him!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.85em;">The faithful doth Jehovah preserve,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.85em;">And plentifully repayeth the proud-doer.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left:8em;">(24) Courage! and let your heart be strong,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.85em;">All ye that wait for Jehovah!</span></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_M_13" id="Footnote_M_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_M_13"><span class="label">[M]</span></a> Confusion (Perowne), distrust (Delitzsch), anguish (Ewald),
trepidation (Calvin). The word literally means to sway backwards
and forwards, and hence to be agitated by any emotion,
principally by fear; and then, perhaps, to flee in terror.</p></div>

<p>The glow of personal attachment to Jehovah
which kindles in the trustful words is eminently
characteristic. It anticipates the final teaching
of the New Testament in bringing all the relations
between God and the devout soul down to
the one bond of love. "We love Him because
He first loved us," says John. And David has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>
the same discernment that the basis of all must
be the outgoing of love from the heart of God,
and that the only response which that seeking
love requires is the awaking of the echo of its
own Divine voice in our hearts. Love begets
love; love seeks love; love rests in love. Our
faith <i>corresponds</i> to His faithfulness, our obedience
to His command, our reverence to His
majesty; but our love <i>resembles</i> His, from which
it draws its life. So the one exhortation is
"love the Lord," and the ground of it lies in
that name&mdash;"His beloved"&mdash;those to whom He
shows His loving-kindness (ver. 21).</p>

<p>The closing words remind us of the last verse
of psalm xxvii. They are distinctly quoted
from it, with the variation that there the heartening
to courage was addressed to his own soul,
and here to "all who wait on the Lord." The
resemblance confirms the reference of both
psalms to the same epoch, while the difference
suits the change in his circumstances from a
period of comparative danger, such as his stay
at Adullam, to one of greater security, like his
residence in Ziklag. The same persons who
were called to love the Lord because they were
participant of His loving-kindness, are now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
called to courage and manly firmness of soul
because their hope is fixed on Jehovah. The
progress of thought is significant and obvious.
Love to God, resting on consciousness of His
love to us, is the true armour. "There is no
fear in love." The heart filled with it is strong
to resist the pressure of outward disasters, while
the empty heart is crushed like a deserted hulk
by the grinding collision of the icebergs that
drift rudderless on the wild wintry sea of life.
Love, too, is the condition of hope. The
patience and expectation of the latter must
come from the present fruition of the sweetness
of the former. Of these fair sisters, Love is the
elder as the greater; it is she who bears in
her hands the rich metal from which Hope
forges her anchor, and the strong cords that
hold it; her experience supplies all the colours
with which her sister paints the dim distance;
and she it is who makes the other bold to be
sure of the future, and clear-sighted to see the
things that are not as though they were. To
love the Lord is the path, and the only path, to
hoping in the Lord. So had the psalmist found
it for himself. In his changeful, perilous years
of exile he had learned that the brightness with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
which hope glowed on his lonely path depended
not on the accident of greater or less external
security, but on the energy of the clear flame of
love in his heart. Not in vain had his trials
been to him, which cast that rich treasure to his
feet from their stormy waves. Not in vain will
ours be to us, if we learn the lesson which he
here would divide with all those "that wait on
the Lord."</p>

<p>Our limits prevent the further examination of
the remaining psalms of this period. It is the
less necessary, inasmuch as those which have
been already considered fairly represent the
whole. The xi., xiii., xvii., xxii., xxv., and lxiv.
may, with varying probability, be considered
as belonging to the Sauline persecution. To
this list some critics would add the xl. and lxix.,
but on very uncertain grounds. But if we exclude
them, the others have a strong family
likeness, not only with each other, but with
those which have been presented to the reader.
The imagery of the wilderness, which has become
so familiar to us, continually reappears;
the prowling wild beasts, the nets and snares,
the hunted psalmist like a timid bird among the
hills; the protestation of innocence, the passion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>ate
invocation of retribution on the wicked, the
confidence that their own devices will come
down on their heads, the intense yearning of
soul after God&mdash;are all repeated in these psalms.
Single metaphors and peculiar phrases which
we have already met with recur&mdash;as, for instance,
"the shadow of Thy wings" (xvii. 8, lvii. 1),
and the singular phrase rendered in our version,
"show Thy marvellous loving-kindness" (xvii.
7, xxxi. 21), which is found only here. In one
of these psalms (xxxv. 13) there seems to be a
reference to his earliest days at the court, and
to the depth of loving sympathy with Saul's
darkened spirit, which he learned to cherish, as
he stood before him to soothe him with the
ordered harmonies of harp and voice. The
words are so definite that they appear to refer
to some historic occasion:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">And as for me&mdash;in their sickness my clothing was sackcloth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8em;">With fasting I humbled my soul,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8em;">And my prayer into my own bosom returned.</span></p>

<p>So truly did he feel for him who is now his foe.
The outward marks of mourning became the
natural expression of his feelings. Such is
plainly the meaning of the two former clauses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
as well as of the following verse. As the whole
is a description of the outward signs of grief, it
seems better to understand the last of these
three clauses as a picture of the bent head
sunk on the bosom even while he prayed,<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> than
to break the connection by referring it either to
the requital of hate for his sympathy,<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> or to the
purity of his prayer, which was such that he
could desire nothing more for himself.<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> He
goes on with the enumeration of the signs of
sorrow: "As if (he had been) a friend, a brother
to me, I went,"&mdash;walking slowly, like a man
absorbed in sorrow: "as one who laments a
mother, in mourning garments I bowed down,"&mdash;walking
with a weary, heavy stoop, like one
crushed by a mother's death, with the garb of
woe. Thus faithfully had he loved, and truly
wept for the noble ruined soul which, blinded
by passion and poisoned by lies, had turned to
be his enemy. And that same love clung by
him to the last, as it ever does with great and
good men, who learn of God to suffer long
and be kind, to bear all things, and hope all
things.</p>

<p>Of these psalms the xxii. is remarkable. In
it David's personal experience seems to afford
only the starting-point for a purely Messianic
prophecy, which embraces many particulars
that far transcend anything recorded of his
sorrows. The impossibility of finding occurrences
in his life corresponding to such traits as
tortured limbs and burning thirst, pierced hands
and parted garments, has driven some critics to
the hypothesis that we have here a psalm of the
exile describing either actual sufferings inflicted
on some unknown confessor in Babylon, or in
figurative language the calamities of Israel there.
But the Davidic origin is confirmed by many
obvious points of resemblance with the psalms
which are indisputably his, and especially
with those of the Sauline period, while the
difficulty of finding historical facts answering to
the emphatic language is evaded, not met, by
either assuming that such facts existed in some
life which has left no trace, or by forcing a
metaphorical sense on words which sound
wonderfully like the sad language of a real
sufferer. Of course, if we believe that prediction
is an absurdity, any difficulty will be lighter
than the acknowledgment that we have pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>diction
here. But, unless we have a foregone
conclusion of that sort to blind us, we shall see
in this psalm a clear example of the prophecy
of a suffering Messiah. In most of the other
psalms where David speaks of his sorrows we
have only a typical foreshadowing of Christ.
But in this, and in such others as lxix. and cix.
(if these are David's), we have type changing
into prophecy, and the person of the psalmist
fading away before the image which, by occasion
of his own griefs, rose vast, and solemn, and
distant before his prophet gaze,&mdash;the image of
One who should be perfectly all which he was
in partial measure, the anointed of God, the
utterer of His name to His brethren, the King
of Israel,&mdash;and whose path to His dominion
should be thickly strewn with solitary sorrow,
and reproach, and agony, to whose far more exceeding
weight of woe all his affliction was light
as a feather, and transitory as a moment. And
when the psalmist had learned that lesson,
besides all the others of trust and patience which
his wanderings taught him, his schooling was
nearly over, he was almost ready for a new
discipline; and the slowly-evolving revelation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
of God's purposes, which by his sorrows had
unfolded more distinctly than before "the
sufferings of the Messiah," was ripening for the
unveiling, in his Kinghood, of "the glory that
should follow."<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<hr />

<h2 class="space"><a name="KING_1" id="KING_1"></a>IX.&mdash;THE KING.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>

<p>We have now to turn and see the sudden
change of fortune which lifted the
exile to a throne. The heavy cloud which had
brooded so long over the doomed king broke
in lightning crash on the disastrous field of
Gilboa. Where is there a sadder and more
solemn story of the fate of a soul which makes
shipwreck "of faith and of a good conscience,"
than that awful page which tells how, godless,
wretched, mad with despair and measureless
pride, he flung himself on his bloody sword,
and died a suicide's death, with sons and armour-bearer
and all his men, a ghastly court of
corpses, laid round him? He had once been
brave, modest, and kind, full of noble purposes
and generous affections&mdash;and he ended so.
Into what doleful regions of hate and darkness
may self-will drag a soul, when once the reins
fall loose from a slackened hand! And what
a pathetic beam of struggling light gleams<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
through heavy clouds, in the grateful exploit
of the men of Jabesh, who remembered how he
had once saved them, while yet he could care
and dare for his kingdom, and perilled their
lives to bear the poor headless corpse to its rude
resting-place!</p>

<p>The news is received by the fugitive at Ziklag
in striking and characteristic fashion. He first
flames out in fierce wrath upon the lying
Amalekite, who had hurried with the tidings
and sought favour by falsely representing that
he had killed the king on the field. A short
shrift and a bloody end were his. And then
the wrath melts into mourning. Forgetting the
mad hatred and wild struggles of that poor
soul, and his own wrongs, remembering only
the friendship and nobleness of his earlier days,
he casts over the mangled corpses of Saul and
Jonathan the mantle of his sweet elegy, and
bathes them with the healing waters of his
unstinted praise and undying love. Not till
these two offices of justice and affection had
been performed, does he remember himself and
the change in his own position which had been
effected. He had never thought of Saul as
standing between him and the kingdom; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>
first feeling on his death was not, as it would
have been with a less devout and less generous
heart, a flush of gladness at the thought of the
empty throne, but a sharp pang of pain from
the sense of an empty heart. And even when
he begins to look forward to his own new
course, there is that same remarkable passiveness
which we have observed already. His
first step is to "inquire of the Lord, saying,
Shall I go up to any of the cities of Judah?"
(2 Sam. ii. 1). He will do nothing in this crisis
of his fortunes, when all which had been so long
a hope seemed to be rapidly becoming a fact,
until his Shepherd shall lead him. Rapid and
impetuous as he was by nature, schooled to
swift decisions, followed by still swifter action,
knowing that a blow struck at once, while all
was chaos and despair at home, might set him
on the throne, he holds nature and policy and
the impatience of his people in check to hear
what God will say. So fully did he fulfil the
vow of his early psalm, "My strength! upon
thee will I wait" (lix. 9).</p>

<p>We can fancy the glad march to the ancient
Hebron, where the great fathers of the nation
lay in their rock-hewn tombs. Even before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
death of Saul, David's strength had been
rapidly increasing, by a constant stream of
fugitives from the confusion and misery into
which the kingdom had fallen. Even Benjamin,
Saul's own tribe, sent him some of its famous
archers&mdash;a sinister omen of the king's waning
fortunes; the hardy half-independent men of
Manasseh and Gad, from the pastoral uplands
on the east of Jordan, "whose faces," according
to the vivid description of the chronicler (1
Chron. xii. 8), "were like the faces of lions, and
were as swift as roes upon the mountains,"
sought his standard; and from his own kinsmen
of Judah recruits "day by day came to
David to help him, until it was a great host
like the host of God." With such forces, it
would have been child's play to have subdued
any scattered troops of the former dynasty
which might still have been in a condition to
keep the field. But he made no attempt of the
sort; and even when he came to Hebron he
took no measures to advance any claims to the
crown. The language of the history seems
rather to imply a disbanding of his army, or at
least their settling down to domestic life in the
villages round Hebron, without a thought of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
winning the kingdom by arms. And his elevation
to the partial monarchy which he at first
possessed was the spontaneous act of "the men
of Judah," who come to him and anoint him
king over Judah.</p>

<p>The limits of his territory are substantially
those of the kingdom over which his descendants
ruled after Jeroboam's revolt, thus indicating
the existence of a natural "line of cleavage"
between north and south. The geographical
position of Benjamin finally attached it to the
latter monarchy; but for the present, the wish
to retain the supremacy which it had had while
the king was one of the tribe, made it the
nucleus of a feeble and lingering opposition to
David, headed by Saul's cousin Abner, and
rallying round his incompetent son Ishbosheth.<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a>
The chronology of this period is obscure.
David reigned in Hebron seven years and a
half, and as Ishbosheth's phantom sovereignty
only occupied two of these years, and those
evidently the last, it would appear almost as if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
the Philistines had held the country, with the
exception of Judah, in such force that no rival
cared to claim the dangerous dignity, and that
five years passed before the invaders were so
far cleared out as to leave leisure for civil war.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_Q_17" id="Footnote_Q_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_Q_17"><span class="label">[Q]</span></a> The Canaanitish worship of Baal seems to have lingered
in Saul's family. One of his grand-uncles was named Baal
(1 Chron. ix. 36); his son was really called Eshbaal (Fire of
Baal), which was contemptuously converted into Ishbosheth
(Man of Shame). So also Mephibosheth was properly Meribbaal
(Fighter for Baal).</p></div>

<p>The summary narrative of these seven years
presents the still youthful king in a very lovable
light. The same temper which had marked
his first acts after Saul's death is strikingly
brought out (2 Sam. ii.-iv.) He seems to
have left the conduct of the war altogether to
Joab, as if he shrank from striking a single
blow for his own advancement. When he does
interfere, it is on the side of peace, to curb
and chastise ferocious vengeance and dastardly
assassination. The incidents recorded
all go to make up a picture of rare generosity,
of patient waiting for God to fulfil His purposes,
of longing that the miserable strife between the
tribes of God's inheritance should end. He
sends grateful messages to Jabesh-Gilead; he
will not begin the conflict with the insurgents.
The only actual fight recorded is provoked by
Abner, and managed with unwonted mildness
by Joab. The list of his children born in
Hebron is inserted in the very heart of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
story of the insurrection, a token of the quiet
domestic life of peaceful joys and cares which
he lived while the storm was raging without.
Eagerly, and without suspicion, he welcomes
Abner's advances towards reconciliation. He
falls for a moment to the level of his times, and
yields to a strong temptation, in making the
restoration of his long-lost wife Michal the
condition of further negotiations&mdash;a demand
which was strictly just, no doubt, but for which
little more can be said. The generosity of his
nature and the ideal purity of his love, which
that incident shadows, shine out again in his
indignation at Joab's murder of Abner, though
he was too meek to avenge it. There is no
more beautiful picture in his life than that of his
following the bier where lay the bloody corpse
of the man who had been his enemy ever since
he had known him, and sealing the reconciliation
which Death ever makes in noble souls, by the
pathetic dirge he chanted over Abner's grave.
We have a glimpse of his people's unbounded
confidence in him, given incidentally when we
are told that his sorrow pleased them, "as whatsoever
the king did pleased all the people."
We have a glimpse of the feebleness of his new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
monarchy as against the fierce soldier who had
done so much to make it, in his acknowledgment
that he was yet weak, being but recently
anointed king, and that these vehement sons of
Zeruiah were too strong for him; and we have
a remarkable trace of connection with the
psalms, in the closing words with which he invokes
on Joab the vengeance which he as yet
felt himself unable to execute: "The Lord shall
reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness."</p>

<p>The only other incident recorded of his reign
in Hebron is his execution of summary justice
upon the murderers of the poor puppet-king
Ishbosheth, upon whose death, following so
closely that of Abner, the whole resistance to
David's power collapses. There had never been
any real popular opposition. His enemies are
emphatically named as "the house of Saul,"
and we find Abner himself admitting that "the
elders of Israel" wanted David as king (2 Sam.
iii. 17), so that when he was gone, it is two
Benjamites who give the <i>coup-de-gr&acirc;ce</i> to Ishbosheth,
and end the whole shadowy rival
power. Immediately the rulers of all the tribes
come up to Hebron, with the tender of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span>
crown. They offer it on the triple grounds of
kinship, of his military service even in Saul's
reign, and of the Divine promise of the throne.
A solemn pact was made, and David was
anointed in Hebron, a king by Divine right, but
also a constitutional monarch chosen by popular
election, and limited in his powers.</p>

<p>The first result of his new strength is the
capture of the old hill-fortress of the Jebusites,
the city of Melchizedek, which had frowned
down upon Israel unsubdued till now, and
whose inhabitants trusted so absolutely in its
natural strength that their answer to the demand
for surrender was the jeer, "Thou wilt not come
hither, but the blind and lame will drive thee
away." This time David does not leave the
war to others. For the first time for seven
years we read, "<i>The king</i> and his men went to
Jerusalem." Established there as his capital,
he reigns for some ten years with unbroken
prosperity over a loyal and loving people,
with this for the summary of the whole
period, "David went on and grew great, and
the Lord God of Hosts was with him" (2 Sam.
v. 10). These years are marked by three principal
events&mdash;the bringing up of the ark to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg&nbsp;153]</a></span>
city of David, the promise by Nathan of the
perpetual dominion of his house, and the unbroken
flow of victories over the surrounding
nations. These are the salient points of the
narrative in the Book of Samuel (2 Sam. v.-viii.),
and are all abundantly illustrated by the
psalms. We shall have next then to consider
"The Songs of the King."</p>

<p>How did the fugitive bear his sudden change
of fortune? What were his thoughts when at
last the dignity which he had ever expected and
never sought was his? The answer is ready to
our hand in that grand psalm (Ps. xviii.) which
he "spake in the day that the Lord delivered
him from all his enemies, and from the hand of
Saul." The language of this superscription
seems to connect the psalm with the period of
internal and external repose which preceded
and prompted David's "purpose to build an
house for the Lord" (2 Sam. vii.) The same
thankfulness which glows so brightly in the
psalm stimulated that desire, and the emphatic
reference to the mercy promised by God to "his
seed for evermore," which closes the hymn,
points perhaps to the definite promise of the
perpetuity of the kingdom to his descendants,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg&nbsp;154]</a></span>
which was God's answer to the same desire.
But whether the psalm belongs to the years of
the partial sovereignty at Hebron, or to those
of the complete dominion at Jerusalem, it cannot
be later than the second of these two dates;
and whatever may have been the time of its
composition, the feelings which it expresses are
those of the first freshness of thankful praise
when he was firmly settled in the kingdom.
Some critics would throw it onwards to the very
close of his life. But this has little in its favour
beyond the fact that the author of the Book of
Samuel has placed his version of the psalm
among the records of David's last days. There
is, however, nothing to show that that position
is due to chronological considerations. The
victories over heathen nations which are supposed
to be referred to in the psalm, and are
relied on by the advocates of later date, really
point to the earlier, which was the time of his
most brilliant conquests. And the marked
assertions of his own purity, as well as the
triumphant tone of the whole, neither of which
characteristics corresponds to the sad and shaded
years after his great fall, point in the same
direction. On the whole, then, we may fairly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg&nbsp;155]</a></span>
take this psalm as belonging to the bright beginning
of the monarchy, and as showing us
how well the king remembered the vows which
the exile had mingled with his tears.</p>

<p>It is one long outpouring of rapturous thankfulness
and triumphant adoration, which streams
from a full heart in buoyant waves of song.
Nowhere else, even in the psalms&mdash;and if not
there, certainly nowhere else&mdash;is there such a
continuous tide of unmingled praise, such magnificence
of imagery, such passion of love to the
delivering God, such joyous energy of conquering
trust. It throbs throughout with the life
blood of devotion. The strong flame, white
with its very ardour, quivers with its own intensity
as it steadily rises heavenward. All the
terrors, and pains, and dangers of the weary
years&mdash;the black fuel for the ruddy glow&mdash;melt
into warmth too great for smoke, too equable
to blaze. The plaintive notes that had so often
wailed from his harp, sad as if the night wind
had been wandering among its chords, have all
led up to this rushing burst of full-toned gladness.
The very blessedness of heaven is anticipated,
when sorrows gone by are understood
and seen in their connection with the joy to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
which they have led, and are felt to be the
theme for deepest thankfulness. Thank God
that, for the consolation of the whole world, we
have this hymn of praise from the same lips
which said, "My life is spent with grief, and
my years with sighing." "We have seen the
end of the Lord, that the Lord is very pitiful
and of tender mercy." The tremulous minors
of trustful sorrow shall swell into rapturous
praise; and he who, compassed with foes, cries
upon God, will, here or yonder, sing this song
"unto the Lord, in the day that the Lord
delivers him from the hand of all his enemies."<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<hr />

<h2 class="space"><a name="KING_2" id="KING_2"></a>X.&mdash;THE KING&mdash;<i><span class="smcap">continued</span></i>.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>

<p>In our last chapter we have seen that the key-note
of "The Songs of the King" may be
said to be struck in Psalm xviii. Its complete
analysis would carry us far beyond our limits.
We can but glance at some of the more prominent
points of the psalm.</p>

<p>The first clause strikes the key-note. "I love
Thee, O Jehovah, my strength." That personal
attachment to God, which is so characteristic of
David's religion, can no longer be pent up in
silence, but gushes forth like some imprisoned
stream, broad and full even from its well-head.
The common word for "love" is too weak for
him, and he bends to his use another, never
elsewhere employed to express man's emotions
towards God, the intensity of which is but
feebly expressed by some such periphrasis as,
"From my heart do I love Thee." The same
exalted feeling is wonderfully set forth by the
loving accumulation of Divine names which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span>
follow, as if he would heap together in one
great pile all the rich experiences of that God,
unnamed after all names, which he had garnered
up in his distresses and deliverances. They tell
so much as the poor vehicle of words can tell,
what his Shepherd in the heavens had been to
him. They are the treasures which he has
brought back from his exile; and they most
pathetically point to the songs of that time.
He had called on God by these names when
it was hard to believe in their reality, and now
he repeats them all in his glad hour of fruition,
for token that they who in their extremity trust
in the name of the Lord will one day have the
truth of faith transformed into truth of experience.
"Jehovah, my rock and my fortress,"
reminds us of his cry in Ziklag, "Thou art my
rock and my fortress" (xxxi. 3), and of the
"hold" (the same word) of Adullam in which
he had lain secure. "My deliverer" echoes
many a sigh in the past, now changed into
music of praise. "My rock" (a different word
from that in a preceding clause), "in whom I
take refuge," recalls the prayer, "Be Thou my
rock of strength" (xxxi. 2), and his former
effort of confidence, when, in the midst of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
calamities, he said, "My soul takes refuge in
Thee" (lvii. 1.) "My shield" carries us back
to the ancient promise, fresh after so many
centuries, and fulfilled anew in every age, "Fear
not, Abram, I am thy shield," and to his own
trustful words at a time when trust was difficult,
"My shield is upon God" (vii. 10). "My high
tower," the last of this glowing series, links on
to the hope breathed in the first song of his
exile, "God is my defence" (the same expression);
"Thou hast been my defence in the day
of trouble" (lix. 9, 16). And then he sums up
his whole past in one general sentence, which
tells his habitual resource in his troubles, and
the blessed help which he has ever found, "I
call on Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised;<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a>
and from my enemies am I saved" (verse 3).</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_R_18" id="Footnote_R_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_R_18"><span class="label">[R]</span></a> The old English word "the worshipful" comes near the
form and meaning of the phrase.</p></div>

<p>No comment can heighten, and no translation
can adequately represent, while none can
altogether destroy the unapproachable magnificence
of the description which follows, of the
majestic coming forth of God in answer to his
cry. It stands at the very highest point, even
when compared with the other sublime passages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
of a like kind in Scripture. How pathetically
he paints his sore need in metaphors which
again bring to mind the songs of the outlaw:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:8em;">The snares of death compassed me,<br />
And floods of destruction made me afraid;<br />
The snares of Sheol surrounded me,<br />
The toils of death surprised me.</p>

<p>As he so often likened himself to some wild
creature in the nets, so here Death, the hunter,
has cast his fatal cords about him, and they are
ready suddenly to close on the unsuspecting
prey. Or, varying the image, he is sinking in
black waters, which are designated by a difficult
phrase (literally, "streams of Belial," or worthlessness),
which is most probably rendered as
above (so Ewald, Hupfeld). In this dire extremity
one thing alone is left him. He is
snared, but he has his voice free to cry with,
and a God to cry to. He is all but sinking,
but he can still shriek (so one of the words
might be rendered) "like some strong swimmer
in his agony." And it is enough. That one
loud call for help rises, like some slender pillar
of incense-smoke, straight into the palace
temple of God&mdash;and, as he says, with a meaning
which our version obscures, "My cry before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg&nbsp;161]</a></span>
Him came into His ears." The prayer that
springs from a living consciousness of being
in God's presence, even when nearest to perishing,
is the prayer that He hears. The cry is
a poor, thin, solitary voice, unheard on earth,
though shrill enough to rise to heaven; the
answer shakes creation. One man in his extremity
can put in motion all the magnificence
of God. Overwhelming is the contrast between
the cause and the effect. And marvellous as
the greatness, so also is the swiftness of the
answer. A moment suffices&mdash;and then! Even
whilst he cries, the rocking earth and the
quivering foundations of the hills are conscious
that the Lord comes from afar for his help.
The majestic self-revelation of God as the
deliverer has for its occasion the psalmist's
cry of distress, and for its issue, "He drew me
out of many waters." All the splendour flames
out because a poor man prays, and all the
upheaval of earth and the artillery of heaven
has simply this for its end, that a poor man
may be delivered. The paradox of prayer
never found a more bold expression than in
this triumphant utterance, of the insignificant
occasion for, and the equally insignificant result<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
sought by, the exercise of the energy of
Omnipotence.</p>

<p>The Divine deliverance is set forth under
the familiar image of the coming of God in a
tempest. Before it bursts, and simultaneous
with the prayer, the "earth rocks and quivers,"
the sunless "pillars of the hills reel and rock
to and fro," as if conscious of the gathering
wrath which begins to flame far off in the
highest heavens. There has been no forth-putting
yet of the Divine power. It is but
accumulating its fiery energy, and already the
solid framework of the world trembles, anticipating
the coming crash. The firmest things
shake, the loftiest bow before His wrath.
"There went up smoke out of his nostrils, and
fire out of his mouth devoured; coals were
kindled by it." This kindling anger, expressed
by these tremendous metaphors, is conceived
of as the preparation in "His temple" for the
earthly manifestation of delivering vengeance.
It is like some distant thunder-cloud which
grows on the horizon into ominous blackness,
and seems to be filling its ashen-coloured depths
with store of lightnings. Then the piled-up
terror begins to move, and, drawing nearer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg&nbsp;163]</a></span>
pours out an avalanche of gloom seamed with
fire. First the storm-cloud descends, hanging
lower and lower in the sky. And whose foot
is that which is planted upon its heavy mass,
thick and frowning enough to be the veil of
God?</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"He bowed the heavens, and came down,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">And blackness of cloud was under His feet."</span></p>

<p>Then the sudden rush of wind which heralds
the lightning breaks the awful silence:&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">And He rode upon a cherub, and did fly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8em;">Yea, He swept along upon the wings of the wind.</span></p>

<p>The cherubs bear, as in a chariot, the throned
God, and the swift pinions of the storm bear
the cherubs. But He that sits upon the throne,
above material forces and the highest creatures,
is unseen. The psalmist's imagination stops at
its base, nor dares to gaze into that light above;
and the silence is more impressive than all
words. Instead of pagan attempts at a likeness
of God, we have next painted, with equal descriptive
accuracy, poetic force, and theological
truth, the pitchy blackness which hides Him. In
the gloom of its depths He makes His "secret
place" His "tent." It is "darkness of waters,"
that is, darkness from which streams out the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>
thunder-rain; it is "thick clouds of the skies;"
or perhaps the expression should be rendered,
"heavy masses of clouds." Then comes the
crash of the tempest. The brightness that lies
closer around Him, and lives in the heart of the
blackness, flames forth, parting the thick clouds&mdash;and
through the awful rent hail and coals of
fire are flung down on the trembling earth.
The grand description may be rendered in two
ways: either that adopted in our version, "At
the brightness that was before Him His thick
clouds passed&mdash;hailstones and coals of fire;"
or, "Through His thick clouds there passed
hailstones and coals of fire." The former of
these is the more dramatic; the broken construction
expresses more vividly the fierce suddenness
of the lightning blaze and of the down-rush
of the hail, and is confirmed by the repetition
of the same words in the same construction
in the next verse. That verse describes another
burst of the tempest&mdash;the deep roll of the
thunder along the skies is the voice of Jehovah,
and again the lightning tears through the
clouds, and the hail streams down. With what
profound truth all this destructive power is
represented as coming from the brightness of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
God&mdash;that "glory" which in its own nature is
light, but in its contact with finite and sinful
creatures must needs become darkness, rent
asunder by lightning! What lessons as to the
root and the essential nature of all punitive acts
of God cluster round such words! and how
calm and blessed the faith which can pierce
even the thickest mass "that veileth Love!"&mdash;to
see the light at the centre, even though the
circumference be brooding thunder-clouds torn
by sudden fires. Then comes the purpose of
all this apocalypse of Divine magnificence. The
fiery arrows scatter the psalmist's enemies. The
waters in which he had well nigh drowned are
dried up before the hot breath of His anger.
"That dread voice" speaks "which shrinks
their streams." And amid the blaze of tempest,
the rocking earth, and the failing floods, His
arm is thrust forth from above, and draws His
servant from many waters. As one in later
times, "he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he
cried, saying, Lord, save me; and immediately
He stretched forth His hand and caught him."</p>

<p>A calmer tone follows, as the psalmist recounts
without metaphor his deliverance, and
reiterates the same assertion of his innocence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>
which we have already found so frequently in
the previous psalms (vers. 17-24). Rising from
his personal experience to the broad and lofty
thoughts of God which that experience had
taught him, as it does all who prize life chiefly
as a means of knowing Him, he proclaims the
solemn truth, that in the exercise of a righteous
retribution, and by the very necessity of our
moral nature, God appears to man what
man is to God: loving to the loving, upright
to the upright, pure to the pure, and
froward to the froward. Our thoughts of God
are shaped by our moral character; the capacity
of perceiving depends on sympathy. "Unless the
eye were light, how could it see the sun?" The
self-revelation of God in His providence, of
which only the psalm speaks, is modified according
to our moral character, being full of
love to those who love, being harsh and antagonistic
to those who set themselves in opposition
to it. There is a higher law of grace,
whereby the sinfulness of man but draws forth
the tenderness of a father's pardoning pity;
and the brightest revelation of His love is made
to froward prodigals. But that is not in the
psalmist's view here, nor does it interfere with
the law of retribution in its own sphere.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg&nbsp;167]</a></span></p>

<p>The purely personal tone is again resumed,
and continued unbroken to the close. In the
former portion David was passive, except for
the voice of prayer, and God's arm alone was
his deliverance. In the latter half he is active,
the conquering king, whose arm is strengthened
for victory by God. This difference may possibly
suggest the reference of the former half to
the Sauline persecution, when, as we have seen,
the exile ever shrunk from avenging himself;
and of the latter to the early years of his
monarchy, which, as we shall see, were characterized
by much successful military activity;
and if so, the date of the psalm would most
naturally be taken to be the close of his victorious
campaigns, when "the Lord had given
him rest from all his enemies round about" (2
Sam. vii. 1). Be that as it may, the latter portion
of the psalm shows us the soldier king
tracing all his past victories to God alone, and
building upon them the confidence of a world-wide
dominion. The point at which memory
passes into hope is difficult to determine, and
great variety of opinion prevails on the matter
among commentators. It is perhaps best to
follow many of the older versions, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg&nbsp;168]</a></span>
valuable exposition of Hupfeld, in regarding
the whole section from ver. 37 of our translation
as the expression of the trust which past experience
had wrought. We shall then have two
periods in the second half of the psalm&mdash;the
past victories won by God's help (vers. 31-36),
the coming triumphs of which these are the
pledge (vers. 37-end).</p>

<p>In the former there shine out not only David's
habitual consciousness of dependence on and
aid from God, but also a very striking picture
of his physical qualifications for a military
leader. He is girded with bodily strength,
swift and sure of foot like a deer, able to scale
the crags where his foes fortified themselves
like the wild antelopes he had so often seen
bounding among the dizzy ledges of the cliffs
in the wilderness; his hands are trained for
war, and his sinewy arms can bend the great
bow of brass. But these capacities are gifts,
and not they, but their Giver, have made him
victorious. Looking back upon all his past,
this is its summing up:&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"Thou hast also given me the shield of Thy salvation,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">And Thy right hand hath holden me up,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">And Thy lowliness hath made me great."</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg&nbsp;169]</a></span></p>

<p>God's strength, God's buckler, God's supporting
hand, God's condescension, by which He bows
down to look upon and help the feeble, with the
humble showing Himself humble&mdash;these have
been his weapons, and from these has come his
victory.</p>

<p>And because of these, he looks forward to a
future like the past, but more glorious still,
thereby teaching us how the unchanging faithfulness
of our God should encourage us to take
all the blessings which we have received as but
the earnest of what is yet to come. He sees
himself pursuing his enemies, and smiting them
to the ground. The fierce light of battle blazes
through the rapid sentences which paint the panic
flight, and the swift pursuit, the vain shrieks to
man and God for succour, and the utter annihilation
of the foe:&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">(42) "And I will pound them like dust before the wind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.25em;">Like street-filth will I empty them out."</span></p>

<p>Then he gives utterance to the consciousness
that his kingdom is destined to extend far
beyond the limits of Israel, in words which, like
so many of the prophecies, may be translated in
the present tense, but are obviously future in
signification&mdash;the prophet placing himself in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg&nbsp;170]</a></span>
imagination in the midst of the time of which
he speaks:&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">(43) "Thou deliverest me from the strivings of the people (<i>i.e.</i>, Israel),</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.2em;">Thou makest me head of the heathen;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.2em;">People whom I knew not serve me.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left:8em;">(44) &nbsp;At the hearing of the ear they obey me.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.2em;">The sons of the stranger feign obedience to me.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left:8em;">(45) &nbsp;The sons of the stranger fade away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.2em;">They come trembling from their hiding-places."</span></p>

<p>The rebellion which weakened his early reign
is subdued, and beyond the bounds of his own
people his dominion spreads. Strange tribes
submit to the very sound of his name, and
crouch before him in extorted and pretended
submission. The words are literally "lie unto
me," descriptive of the profuse professions of
loyalty characteristic of conquered orientals.
Their power withers before him like a gathered
flower before a hot wind, and the fugitives creep
trembling out of their holes where they have
hid themselves.</p>

<p>Again he recurs to the one thought which
flows like a river of light through all the psalm&mdash;that
all his help is in God. The names which
he lovingly heaped together at the beginning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg&nbsp;171]</a></span>
are in part echoed in the close. "The Lord
liveth, and blessed is my rock, and the God of
my salvation is exalted." His deliverances
have taught him to know a living God, swift to
hear, active to help, in whom he lives, who has
magnified His own name in that He has saved
His servant. And as that blessed conviction is
the sum of all his experience, so one glad vow
expresses all his resolves, and thrills with the
expectation which he had cherished even in his
lonely exile, that the music of his psalm would
one day echo through all the world. With lofty
consciousness of his new dignity, and with lowly
sense that it is God's gift, he emphatically
names himself <i>His</i> king, <i>His</i> anointed, taking,
as it were, his crown from his brows and laying
it on the altar. With prophetic eye he looks
onward, and sees the throne to which he had
been led by a series of miracles enduring for
ever, and the mercy of God sustaining the
dominion of his house through all generations:&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">(49) "Therefore will I give thanks to Thee among the nations, O Jehovah,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.25em;">And to Thy name will I strike the harp:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left:8em;">(50) &nbsp;Who maketh great the deliverances of His king</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.25em;">And executeth mercy for His anointed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.25em;">For David and his seed for evermore."</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg&nbsp;172]</a></span></p>

<p>And what were his purposes for the future?
Here is his answer, in a psalm which has been
with considerable appropriateness regarded as a
kind of manifesto of the principles which he intended
should characterize his reign (Psa. ci.):
"I will walk within my house with a perfect
heart. I will set no wicked thing before mine
eyes." For himself, he begins his reign with
noble self-restraint, not meaning to make it a
region of indulgence, but feeling that there is a
law above his will, of which he is only the servant,
and knowing that if his people and his
public life are to be what they should be, his
own personal and domestic life must be pure.
As for his court and his ministers, he will make
a clean sweep of the vermin who swarm and
sting and buzz about a throne. The froward,
the wicked, privy slanderers, proud hearts,
crafty plotters, liars, and evil-doers he will not
suffer&mdash;but "mine eyes shall be upon the faithful
in the land; he that walketh in a perfect
way, he shall serve me." He is fired with
ambition, such as has brightened the beginning
of many a reign which has darkened to cruelty
and crime, to make his kingdom some faint
image of God's, and to bring the actual Israel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg&nbsp;173]</a></span>
into conformity with its ancient Magna Charta,
"Ye shall be to me a holy nation." And so,
not knowing perhaps how hard a task he
planned, and little dreaming of his own sore
fall, he grasps the sword, resolved to use it for
the terror of evil-doers, and vows, "I will early
destroy all the wicked in the land, that I may
cut off all wicked doers from the city of the
Lord." Such was his "proclamation against
vice and immorality" on his accession to his
throne.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h2 class="space"><a name="KING_3" id="KING_3"></a>XI.&mdash;THE KING&mdash;<i><span class="smcap">continued</span></i>.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg&nbsp;174]</a></span>

<p>The years thus well begun are, in the
historical books, characterized mainly by
three events, namely, the bringing up of the ark
to the newly won city of David, Nathan's
prophecy of the perpetual dominion of his house,
and his victories over the surrounding nations.
These three hinges of the narrative are all abundantly
illustrated in the psalms.</p>

<p>As to the first, we have relics of the joyful
ceremonial connected with it in two psalms, the
fifteenth and twenty-fourth, which are singularly
alike not only in substance but in manner, both
being thrown into a highly dramatic form by
question and answer. This peculiarity, as we
shall see, is one of the links of connection which
unite them with the history as given in the Book
of Samuel (2 Sam. vi.). From that record we
learn that David's first thought after he was
firmly seated as king over all Israel, was the
enthronement in his recently-captured city of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg&nbsp;175]</a></span>
the long-forgotten ark. That venerable symbol
of the presence of the true King had passed
through many vicissitudes since the days when
it had been carried round the walls of Jericho.
Superstitiously borne into battle, as if it were a
mere magic palladium, by men whose hearts
were not right with God, the presence which
they had invoked became their ruin, and Israel
was shattered, and "the ark of God taken," on
the fatal field of Aphek. It had been carried in
triumph through Philistine cities, and sent back
in dismay. It had been welcomed with gladness
by the villagers of Bethshemesh, who lifted their
eyes from their harvest work, and saw it borne
up the glen from the Philistine plain. Their
rude curiosity was signally punished, "and the
men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand
before this holy Lord God, and to whom shall
He go up from us?" It had been removed to
the forest seclusion of Kirjath-jearim (the city
of the woods), and there bestowed in the house
of Abinadab "upon the hill," where it lay
neglected and forgotten for about seventy years.
During Saul's reign they "inquired not at it,"
and, indeed, the whole worship of Jehovah seems
to have been decaying. David set himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg&nbsp;176]</a></span>
to reorganize the public service of God, arranged
a staff of priests and Levites, with disciplined
choir and orchestra (1 Chron. xv.), and then proceeded
with representatives of the whole nation
to bring up the ark from its woodland hiding-place.
But again death turned gladness into
dread, and Uzzah's fate silenced the joyous
songs, "and David was afraid of the Lord that
day, and said, How shall the ark of God come
unto me?" The dangerous honour fell on the
house of Obed-edom; and only after the blessing
which followed its three months' stay there,
did he venture to carry out his purpose. The
story of the actual removal of the ark to the city
of David with glad ceremonial need not be
repeated here; nor the mocking gibes of Michal
who had once loved him so fondly. Probably
she bitterly resented her violent separation from
the household joys that had grown up about her
in her second home; probably the woman who
had had teraphim among her furniture cared
nothing for the ark of God; probably, as she
grew older, her character had hardened in its
lines, and become like her father's in its measureless
pride, and in its half-dread, half-hatred
of David&mdash;and all these motives together pour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>
their venom into her sarcasm. Taunts provoke
taunts; the husband feels that the wife is in
heart a partisan of the fallen house of her father,
and a despiser of the Lord and of His worship;
her words hiss with scorn, his flame with anger
and rebuke&mdash;and so these two that had been so
tender in the old days part for ever. The one
doubtful act that stained his accession was
quickly avenged. Better for both that she had
never been rent from that feeble, loving husband
that followed her weeping, and was driven back
by a single word, flung at him by Abner as
if he had been a dog at their heels! (2 Sam.
iii. 16).</p>

<p>The gladness and triumph, the awe, and the
memories of victory which clustered round the
dread symbol of the presence of the Lord of
Hosts, are wonderfully expressed in the choral
twenty-fourth psalm. It is divided into two
portions, which Ewald regards as being originally
two independent compositions. They
are, however, obviously connected both in form
and substance. In each we have question and
answer, as in psalm xv., which belongs to the
same period. The first half replies to the
question, "Who shall ascend the hill of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg&nbsp;178]</a></span>
Lord, and who shall stand in His holy place?"&mdash;an
echo of the terror-struck exclamation of
the people of Bethshemesh, already quoted.
The answer is a description of the <i>men who
dwell with God</i>. The second half deals with
the correlative inquiry, "Who is the King of
Glory?" and describes the <i>God who comes to dwell
with men</i>. It corresponds in substance, though not
in form, with David's thought when Uzzah died,
in so far as it regards God as drawing near to
the worshippers, rather than the worshippers
drawing near to Him. Both portions are united
by a real internal connection, in that they set
forth the mutual approach of God and man
which leads to communion, and thus constitute
the two halves of an inseparable whole.</p>

<p>Most expositors recognise a choral structure
in the psalm, as in several others of this date, as
would be natural at the time of the reorganization
of the public musical service. Probably we may
gain the key to its form by supposing it to be a
processional hymn, of which the first half was to
be sung during the ascent to the city of David,
and the second while standing before the gates.
We have then to fancy the long line of worshippers
climbing the rocky steep hill-side to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg&nbsp;179]</a></span>
ancient fortress so recently won, the Levites
bearing the ark, and the glad multitude streaming
along behind them.</p>

<p>First there swells forth from all the singers
the triumphant proclamation of God's universal
sovereignty, "The earth is the Lord's and the
fulness thereof; the world and they that dwell
therein. For He hath founded it upon the seas
and established it upon the floods." It is very
noteworthy that such a thought should precede
the declaration of His special dwelling in Zion.
It guards that belief from the abuses to which it
was of course liable&mdash;the superstitions, the narrowness,
the contempt of all the rest of the
world as God-deserted, which are its perversion
in sensuous natures. If Israel came to fancy
that God belonged to them, and that there was
only one sacred place in all the world, it was not
for want of clear utterances to the contrary,
which became more emphatic with each fresh
step in the development of the specializing
system under which they lived. The very
ground of their peculiar relation to God had
been declared, in the hour of constituting it to
be&mdash;"all the earth is Mine" (Exod. xix. 5). So
now, when the symbol of His presence is to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg&nbsp;180]</a></span>
a local habitation in the centre of the national
life, the psalmist lays for the foundation of his
song the great truth, that the Divine presence is
concentrated in Israel, but not confined there,
and concentrated in order that it may be diffused.
The glory that lights the bare top of Zion lies
on all the hills; and He who dwells between
the cherubim dwells in all the world, which His
continual presence fills with its fulness, and
upholds above the floods.</p>

<p>Then, as they climb, a single voice perhaps
chants the solemn question, "Who shall ascend
the hill of the Lord, or who shall stand in the
place of His holiness?"</p>

<p>And the full-toned answer portrays the men
who shall dwell with God, in words which begin
indeed with stringent demands for absolute
purity, but wonderfully change in tone as they
advance, into gracious assurances, and the
clearest vision that the moral nature which fits
for God's presence is God's gift. "The clean-handed,
and pure-hearted, who has not lifted up
his soul to vanity, nor sworn deceitfully;" there is
the eternal law which nothing can ever alter, that
to abide with God a man must be like God&mdash;the
law of the new covenant as of the old, "Blessed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg&nbsp;181]</a></span>
are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
But this requirement, impossible of fulfilment,
is not all. If it were, the climbing procession
might stop. But up and up they rise, and
once again the song bursts forth in deeper and
more hopeful words, "He shall <i>receive</i> the
blessing from Jehovah, and righteousness from
the God of his salvation." Then that righteousness,
which he who honestly attempts to comply
with such requirements will soon find that he
does not possess, is to be received from above,
not elaborated from within; is a gift from God,
not a product of man's toils. God will make us
pure, that we may dwell with Him. Nor is this
all. The condition of receiving such a gift has
been already partially set forth in the preceding
clause, which seems to require righteousness to
be possessed as the preliminary to receiving it.
The paradox which thus results is inseparable
from the stage of religious knowledge attained
under the Mosaic Law. But the last words of
the answer go far beyond it, and proclaim the
special truth of the gospel, that the righteousness
which fits for dwelling with God is given on the
simple condition of <i>seeking</i> Him. To this designation
of the true worshippers is appended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg&nbsp;182]</a></span>
somewhat abruptly the one word "Jacob," which
need neither be rendered as in the English
version as an invocation, nor as in the margin,
with an unnecessary and improbable supplement,
"O God of Jacob;" but is best regarded as in
apposition with the other descriptive clauses, and
declaring, as we have found David doing already
in previous psalms, that the characters portrayed
in them, and these only, constituted the true
Israel.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 8em;">This is the generation of them that seek Him,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">That seek Thy face&mdash;(this is) Jacob.</span></p>

<p>And so the first question is answered, "Who are
the men who dwell with God?"&mdash;The pure,
who receive righteousness, who seek Him, the
true Israel.</p>

<p>And now the procession has reached the front
of the ancient city on the hill, and stands before
the very walls and weather-beaten gates which
Melchizedek may have passed through, and
which had been barred against Israel till David's
might had burst them. National triumph and
glad worship are wonderfully blended in the
summons which rings from the lips of the
Levites without: "Lift up your heads, O ye
gates! and be ye lift up, ye doors (that have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg&nbsp;183]</a></span>
been from) of old!" as if even their towering
portals were too low, "and the King of glory
shall come in." What force in that name here,
in this early song of the King! How clearly he
recognises his own derived power, and the real
Monarch of whom he is but the shadowy representative!
The newly-conquered city is summoned
to admit its true conqueror and sovereign,
whose throne is the ark, which was emphatically
named "the glory,"<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a> and in whose
train the earthly king follows as a subject and
a worshipper. Then, with wonderful dramatic
force, a single voice from within the barred
gates asks, like some suspicious warder, "Who
then is the King of glory?" With what a
shout of proud confidence and triumphant
memories of a hundred fields comes, ready and
full, the crash of many voices in the answer,
"Jehovah strong and mighty, Jehovah mighty
in battle!" How vividly the reluctance of an
antagonistic world to yield to Israel and Israel's
King, is represented in the repetition of the
question in a form slightly more expressive of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg&nbsp;184]</a></span>
ignorance and doubt, in answer to the reiterated
summons, "Who is He, then, the King of glory?"
With what deepened intensity of triumph there
peals, hoarse and deep, the choral shout, "The
Lord of Hosts, He is the King of glory." That
name which sets Him forth as Sovereign of the
personal and impersonal forces of the universe&mdash;angels,
and stars, and terrene creatures, all
gathered in ordered ranks, embattled for His
service&mdash;was a comparatively new name in
Israel,<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a> and brought with it thoughts of irresistible
might in earth and heaven. It crashes
like a catapult against the ancient gates; and
at that proclamation of the omnipotent name of
the God who dwells with men, they grate back
on their brazen hinges, and the ark of the Lord
enters into its rest.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg&nbsp;185]</a></span>

<p>The second event recorded as important in
the bright early years is the great promise
of the perpetuity of the kingdom in
David's house. As soon as the king was firmly
established and free from war, he remembered
the ancient word which said, "When He giveth
you rest from all your enemies round about, so
that ye dwell in safety, then there shall be a
place which the Lord your God shall choose
to cause His name to dwell there" (Deut.
xii. 10, 11). His own ease rebukes him; he
regards his tranquillity not as a season for
selfish indolence, but as a call to new forms
of service. He might well have found in the
many troubles and vicissitudes of his past life
an excuse for luxurious repose now. But
devout souls will consecrate their leisure as
their toil to God, and will serve Him with
thankful offerings in peace whom they invoked
with earnest cries in battle. Prosperity is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg&nbsp;186]</a></span>
harmless only when it is accepted as an opportunity
for fresh forms of devotion, not as an
occasion for idle self-indulgence. So we read,
with distinct verbal reference to the words
already quoted, that "when the Lord had given
him rest round about from all his enemies,
the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See
now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the
ark of God dwelleth in curtains." The impulse
of generous devotion, which cannot bear to
lavish more upon self than it gives to God,
at first commended itself to the prophet; but
in the solitude of his nightly thoughts the
higher wisdom speaks in his spirit, and the
word of God gives him a message for the king.
The narrative in 2 Sam. makes no mention of
David's warlike life as unfitting him for the
task, which we find from 2 Chron. was one
reason why his purpose was set aside, but
brings into prominence the thought that David's
generous impulse was outrunning God's commandment,
and that his ardour to serve was in
some danger of forgetting his entire dependence
on God, and of fancying that God would be the
better for him. So the prophetic message reminds
him that the Lord had never, through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg&nbsp;187]</a></span>
all the centuries, asked for a house of cedar,
and recalls the past life of David as having
been wholly shaped and blessed by Him, while
it pointedly inverts the king's proposal in its
own grand promise, "The Lord telleth thee
that He will make thee an house." Then
follows the prediction of a son of David who
should build the house, whose kingdom should
be perpetual, whose transgressions should be
corrected indeed, but never punished as those
of the unhappy Saul; and then, in emphatic
and unmistakable words, the perpetuity of
David's house, his kingdom, and his throne,
is reiterated as the close of the whole.</p>

<p>The wonderful burst of praise which sprang
from David's heart in answer cannot be dealt
with here; but clearly from that time onwards
a new element had been added to his hopes,
and a new object presented to his faith. The
prophecy of the Messiah enters upon a new
stage, bearing a relation, as its successive stages,
always unmistakably did, to the history which
supplies a framework for it. Now for the first
time can he be set forth as the king of Israel;
now the width of the promise which at first
had embraced the seed of the woman, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg&nbsp;188]</a></span>
had been narrowed to the seed of Abraham,
and thereafter probably to the tribe of Judah,
is still further defined as to be fulfilled in the
line of the house of David; now the personal
Messiah Himself begins to be discerned through
the words which are to have a preparatory
fulfilment, in itself prophetic, in the collective
Davidic monarchs whose very office is itself
also a prophecy.</p>

<p>Many echoes of this new message ring through
the later psalms of the king. His own dominion,
his conquests, and his office, gradually became
to himself a solemn prophecy of a mysterious
descendant who should be really and fully all
that he was in shadow and in part. As the
experience of the exile, so that of the victorious
monarch supplied the colours with which the
spirit of prophecy in him painted "beforehand
the sufferings of Christ and the glory that
should follow." In both classes of psalms we
have two forms of the Messianic reference, the
typical and the purely prophetic. In the former
the events of David's own biography and the
feelings of his own soul are so portrayed and
expressed as to suggest his greater Son. In
the latter, the personality of the psalmist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg&nbsp;189]</a></span>
retreats into the background, and is at most
only the starting-point for wails of sorrow or
gleams of glory which far transcend anything
in the life of the singer. There are portions,
for instance, of the xxii. and lxix. psalms which
no torturing can force into correspondence with
any of David's trials; and in like manner there
are p&aelig;ans of victory and predictions of dominion
which demand a grander interpretation than his
own royalty or his hopes for his house can yield.
Of course, if prophecy is impossible, there is no
more to be said, but that in that case a considerable
part of the Old Testament, including
many of David's psalms, is unintelligible.</p>

<p>Perhaps the clearest instance of distinct prophecy
of the victorious dominion of the personal
Messiah is the 110th psalm. In it we do see, no
doubt, the influence of the psalmist's own history,
shaping the image which rises before his soul.
But the attributes of that king whom he
beholds are not his attributes, nor those of any
son of his who wore the crown in Israel. And
whilst his own history gives the form, it is "the
Spirit of Christ that was in" him which gives
the substance, and transfigures the earthly
monarchy into a heavenly dominion. We do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg&nbsp;190]</a></span>
not enter upon the question of the Davidic
authorship of this psalm. Here we have not to
depend upon Jewish superscriptions, but on the
words of Him whose bare assertion should be
"an end of all strife." Christ says that David
wrote it. Some of us are far enough behind the
age to believe that what He said He meant, and
that what He meant is truth.</p>

<p>This psalm, then, being David's, can hardly
be earlier than the time of Nathan's prophecy.
There are traces in it of the influence of the history
of the psalmist, giving, as we have said, form to
the predictions. Perhaps we may see these in
Zion being named as the seat of Messiah's sovereignty
and in the reference to Melchizedek,
both of which points assume new force if we
suppose that the ancient city over which that
half-forgotten name once ruled had recently
become his own. Possibly, too, his joy in
exchanging his armour and kingly robe for the
priest's ephod, when he brought up the ark to
its rest, and his consciousness that in himself
the regal and the sacerdotal offices did not
blend, may have led him to meditations on the
meaning of both, on the miseries that seemed to
flow equally from their separation and from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg&nbsp;191]</a></span>
their union, which were the precursors of his
hearing the Divine oath that, in the far-off
future, they would be fused together in that
mighty figure who was to repeat in higher
fashion the union of functions which invested
that dim King of Righteousness and Priest of
God in the far-off past. He discerns that <i>his</i>
support from the right hand of God, <i>his</i> sceptre
which he swayed in Zion, <i>his</i> loyal people fused
together into a unity at last, <i>his</i> triumphant warfare
on the nations around, are all but faint
shadows of One who is to come. That solemn
form on the horizon of hope is his Lord, the
true King whose viceroy he was, the "bright
consummate flower" for the sake of which the
root has its being. And, as he sees the majestic
lineaments shimmering through the facts of his
own history, like some hidden fire toiling in a
narrow space ere it leaps into ruddy spires that
burst their bonds and flame heaven high, he is
borne onwards by the prophetic impulse, and
the Spirit of God speaks through his tongue
words which have no meaning unless their theme
be a Divine ruler and priest for all the world.</p>

<p>He begins with the solemn words with which
a prophetic message is wont to be announced,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg&nbsp;192]</a></span>
thus at the outset stamping on the psalm its
true character. The "oracle" or "word of
Jehovah unto my Lord," which he heard, is a
new revelation made to him from the heavens.
He is taken up and listens to the Divine voice
calling to His right hand, to the most intimate
communion with Himself, and to wielding the
energies of omnipotence&mdash;Him whom David
knew to be his lord. And when that Divine
voice ceases, its mandate having been fulfilled,
the prophetic spirit in the seer hymns the coronation
anthem of the monarch enthroned by
the side of the majesty in the heavens. "The
sceptre of Thy strength will Jehovah send out
of Zion. Rule Thou in the midst of Thine
enemies." In singular juxtaposition are the
throne at God's right hand and the sceptre&mdash;the
emblem of sovereignty&mdash;issuing from
Zion, a dominion realised on earth by a monarch
in the heavens, a dominion the centre of which
is Zion, and the undefined extent universal. It
is a monarchy, too, established in the midst of
enemies, sustained in spite of antagonism not
only by the power of Jehovah, but by the
activity of the sovereign's own "rule." It is a
dominion for the maintenance of which devout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg&nbsp;193]</a></span>
souls will burst into prayer, and the most
powerful can bring but their aspirations. But
the vision includes more than the warrior king
and his foes. Imbedded, as it were, in the very
heart of the description of the former comes the
portraiture of his subjects, for a witness how
close is the union between Him and them, and
how inseparable from His glories are those who
serve Him. They are characterised in a threefold
manner. "Thy people (shall be) willing in
the day of Thine array." The army is being
mustered.<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a> They are not mercenaries, nor
pressed men. They flock gladly to the standard,
like the warriors celebrated of old in
Deborah's chant of victory, who "willingly
offered themselves." The word of our psalm
might be translated "freewill offerings," and the
whole clause carries us into the very heart of
that great truth, that glad consecration and
grateful self-surrender is the one bond which
knits us to the Captain of our salvation who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg&nbsp;194]</a></span>
gave Himself for us, to the meek Monarch
whose crown is of thorns and His sceptre a reed,
for tokens that His dominion rests on suffering
and is wielded in gentleness. The next words
should be punctuated as a separate clause, co-ordinate
with the former, and adding another
feature to the description of the army. "In the
beauties of holiness" is a common name for the
dress of the priests: the idea conveyed is that
the army is an army of priests, as the king himself
is a priest. They are clothed, not in mail
and warlike attire, but in "fine linen clean and
white," like the armies which a later prophet
saw following the Lord of lords. Their warfare
is not to be by force and cruelty, nor their
conquests bloody; but while soldiers they are
to be priests, their weapons purity and devotion,
their merciful struggle to bring men to God,
and to mirror God to men. Round the one
image gather all ideas of discipline, courage,
consecration to a cause, loyalty to a leader;
round the other, all thoughts of gentleness, of
an atmosphere of devotion calm and still as the
holy place, of stainless character. Christ's servants
must be both soldiers and priests, like
some of those knightly orders who bore the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg&nbsp;195]</a></span>
cross on helmet and shield, and shaped the very
hilts of their swords into its likeness. And
these soldier-priests are described by yet
another image, "From the womb of the morning
thou hast the dew of thy youth," where we
are to regard the last word as used in a collective
sense, and equivalent to "Thy young
warriors." They are like the dew sparkling in
infinite globelets on every blade of grass, hanging
gems on every bit of dead wood, formed
in secret silence, reflecting the sunlight, and,
though the single drops be small and feeble,
yet together freshening the thirsty world. So,
formed by an unseen and mysterious power, one
by one insignificant, but in the whole mighty,
mirroring God and quickening and beautifying
the worn world, the servants of the priest-king
are to be "in the midst of many people like the
dew from the Lord."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_U_21" id="Footnote_U_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_U_21"><span class="label">[U]</span></a> The word translated "power" in our version, has the
same double meaning as that has in old English, or as "force"
has now, sometimes signifying "strength" and sometimes an
"army." The latter is the more appropriate here. "The day
of Thine army" will then be equivalent to the day of mustering
the troops.</p></div>

<p>Another solemn word from the lips of God
begins the second half of the psalm. "Jehovah
swears," gives the sanction and guarantee of His
own nature, puts in pledge His own being
for the fulfilment of the promise. And
that which He swears is a new thing in
the earth. The blending of the royal and
priestly offices in the Messiah, and the eternal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg&nbsp;196]</a></span>
duration in Him of both, is a distinct advancement
in the development of Messianic prophecy.
The historical occasion for it may indeed be
connected with David's kingship and conquest
of Melchizedek's city; but the real source of it
is a direct predictive inspiration. We have here
not merely the devout psalmist meditating on
the truths revealed before his day, but the
prophet receiving a new word from God unheard
by mortal ears, and far transcending even the
promises made to him by Nathan. There is
but one person to whom it can apply, who sits
as a priest upon his throne, who builds the
temple of the Lord (Zech. vi. 12, 13).</p>

<p>As the former Divine word, so this is followed
by the prophet's rapturous answer, which carries
on the portraiture of the priest-king. There is
some doubt as to the person addressed in these
later verses. "The Lord at thy right hand
crushes kings in the day of His wrath." Whose
right hand? The answer generally given is,
"The Messiah's." Who is the Lord that smites
the petty kinglets of earth? The answer
generally given is, "God." But it is far more
dramatic, avoids an awkward abruptness in the
change of persons in the last verse, and brings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg&nbsp;197]</a></span>
out a striking contrast with the previous half, if
we take the opposite view, and suppose Jehovah
addressed and the Messiah spoken of throughout.
Then the first Divine word is followed by
the prophetic invocation of the exalted Messiah
throned at the right hand and expecting till
His enemies be made His footstool. The second
is followed by the prophetic invocation of
Jehovah, and describes the Lord Messiah at
God's right hand as before, but instead of longer
waiting He now flames forth in all the resistless
energy of a conqueror. The day of His array
is succeeded by the day of His wrath. He
crushes earth's monarchies. The psalmist's eye
sees the whole earth one great battle-field.
"(It is) full of corpses. He wounds the head
over wide lands," where there may possibly be
a reference to the first vague dawning of a hope
which God's mercy had let lighten on man's
horizon&mdash;"He shall bruise thy head," or the
word may be used as a collective expression
for rulers, as the parallelism with the previous
verse requires. Thus striding on to victory
across the prostrate foe, and pursuing the flying
relics of their power, "He drinks of the brook
in the way, therefore shall He lift up the head,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg&nbsp;198]</a></span>
words which are somewhat difficult, however interpreted.
If, with the majority of modern
commentators, we take them as a picturesque
embodiment of eager haste in the pursuit, the
conqueror "faint, yet pursuing," and stooping
for a moment to drink, then hurrying on with
renewed strength after the fugitives, one can
scarcely help feeling that such a close to such a
psalm is trivial and liker the artificial play of
fancy than the work of the prophetic spirit, to
say nothing of the fact that there is nothing
about pursuit in the psalm. If we fall back on
the older interpretation, which sees in the words
a prophecy of the sufferings of the Messiah
who tastes death and drinks of the cup of
sorrows, and therefore is highly exalted, we
get a meaning which worthily crowns the
psalm, but seems to break somewhat abruptly
the sequence of thought, and to force the
metaphor of drinking of the brook into somewhat
strained parallelism with the very different
New Testament images just named. But the
doubt we must leave over these final words does
not diminish the preciousness of this psalm as a
clear, articulate prophecy from David's lips of
David's Son, whom he had learned to know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg&nbsp;199]</a></span>
through the experiences and facts of his own
life. He had climbed through sufferings to his
throne. God had exalted him and given him
victory, and surrounded him with a loyal people.
But he was only a shadow; limitations and
imperfections surrounded his office and weakened
himself; half of the Divine counsel of
peace could not be mirrored in his functions at
all, and death lay ahead of him. So his glory
and his feebleness alike taught him that "one
mightier than" he must be coming behind him,
"the latchet of whose shoes he was not worthy
to unloose"&mdash;the true King of Israel, to bear
witness to whom was his highest honour.</p>

<p>The third characteristic of the first seventeen
years of David's reign is his successful wars with
surrounding nations. The gloomy days of
defeat and subjugation which had darkened the
closing years of Saul are over now, and blow
after blow falls with stunning rapidity on the
amazed enemies. The narrative almost pants
for breath as it tells with hurry and pride how,
south, and east, and north, the "lion of the tribe of
Judah" sprang from his fastness, and smote
Philistia, Edom, Moab, Ammon, Amalek, Damascus,
and the Syrians beyond, even to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg&nbsp;200]</a></span>
Euphrates; and the bounding courage of king
and people, and the unity of heart and hand
with which they stood shoulder to shoulder in
many a bloody field, ring through the psalms of
this period. Whatever higher meaning may be
attached to them, their roots are firm in the soil
of actual history, and they are first of all the
war-songs of a nation. That being so, that
they should also be inspired hymns for the
church in all ages will present no difficulty nor
afford any consecration to modern warfare, if
the progressive character of revelation be duly
kept in mind. There is a whole series of such
psalms, such as xx., xxi., lx., and probably lxviii.
We cannot venture in our limited space on any
analysis of the last of these. It is a splendid
burst of national triumph and devout praise, full
of martial ardour, throbbing with lofty consciousness
of God's dwelling in Israel, abounding
with allusions to the ancient victories of the
people, and world-wide in its anticipations of
future triumph. How strange the history of its
opening words has been! Through the battle
smoke of how many a field they have rung!
On the plains of the Palatinate, from the lips of
Cromwell's Ironsides, and from the poor pea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg&nbsp;201]</a></span>sants
that went to death on many a bleak moor
for Christ's crown and covenant, to the Doric
music of their rude chant&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:8em;">"Let God arise, and scattered</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">Let all His enemies be;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:8.25em;">And let all those that do Him hate,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">Before His presence flee."</span></p>

<p>The sixtieth psalm is assigned to David after
Joab's signal victory over the Edomites (2 Sam.
viii.). It agrees very well with that date,
though the earlier verses have a wailing tone so
deep over recent disasters, so great that one is
almost inclined to suppose that they come from
a later hand than his. But after the first verses
all is warlike energy and triumph. How the glad
thought of ruling over a united people dances
in the swift words, "I will rejoice, I will divide
Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth;"
he has, as it were, repeated Joshua's conquest
and division of the land, and the ancient historical
sites that fill a conspicuous place in the
history of his great ancestor are in his power.
"Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine, Ephraim
also is the defence of my head, Judah my staff
of command." He looks eastward to the woods
and pastoral uplands across the Jordan, whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg&nbsp;202]</a></span>
inhabitants had been but loosely attached to
the western portion of the nation, and triumphs
in knowing that Gilead and Manasseh own his
sway. The foremost tribes on this side the river
are to him like the armour and equipments of a
conqueror; he wears the might of Ephraim,
the natural head of the northern region, as his
helmet, and he grasps the power of Judah
as his baton of command or sceptre of kingly
rule (Gen. xlix. 10).</p>

<p>Thus, strong in the possession of a united
kingdom, his flashing eye turns to his enemies,
and a stern joy, mingled with contempt, blazes
up as he sees them reduced to menial offices
and trembling before him. "Moab (is) my
washing-basin; to Edom will I fling my shoe;
because of me, Philistia, cry out" (in fear). The
three ancestral foes that hung on Israel's
southern border from east to west are subdued.
He will make of one "a vessel of dishonour" to
wash his feet, soiled with battle; he will throw
his shoes to another the while, as one would to
a slave to take care of; and the third, expecting
a like fate, shrieks out in fear of the impending
vengeance. He pants for new victories, "Who
will bring me into (the) strong city?" probably
the yet unsubdued Petra, hidden away in its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg&nbsp;203]</a></span>
tortuous ravine, with but one perilous path
through the gorge. And at last all the triumph
of victory rises to a higher region of thought in
the closing words, which lay bare the secret of
his strength, and breathe the true spirit of
the soldier of Jehovah. "In God we shall do
valiantly; and He, even He, shall tread down
our enemies."</p>

<p>The twentieth psalm, another of these stirring
war-songs, is in that choral manner which we
have already seen in psalm xxiv., and the adoption
of which was probably connected with
David's careful organization of "the service of
song." It is all ablaze with the light of battle
and the glow of loyal love.</p>

<p>The army, ready drawn up for action, as we
may fancy, prays for the king, who, according to
custom, brings sacrifices and offerings before the
fight. "Jehovah hear thee in the day of trouble;
the name of the God of Jacob defend thee, send
thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen
thee out of Zion, remember all thine offerings,
and accept thy burnt sacrifice." Then, as they
wave their standards in the sunshine, or plant
before the ranks of each tribe its cognizance, to
be defended to the death, the hoarse shout rises
from the files, "In the name of our God we will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg&nbsp;204]</a></span>
set up (or wave) our banners." Then the
single voice of the king speaks, rejoicing in his
soldiers' devotion, which he accepts as an omen
that his sacrifice has not been in vain: "Now
know I that Jehovah saveth His anointed. He
will hear him from the heaven of His holiness
with the strength of the salvation of His right
hand;" not merely from a God dwelling in Zion,
according to language of the previous prayer,
but from the Lord in the heavens, will the
strength come. Then again the chorus of the
host exclaims, as they look across the field to
the chariots and cavalry of the foe&mdash;forces which
Israel seldom used&mdash;"These (boast<a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a>) of chariots,
and those of horses, and we, of the name of
Jehovah, our God, do we boast." Ere a sword
has been drawn, they see the enemy scattered.
"They are brought down and fallen; and we,
we are risen and stand upright." Then one
earnest cry to God, one more thought of the
true monarch of Israel, whom David would
teach them to feel he only shadowed; and
with the prayer, "Jehovah! save! Let the King
hear us in the day when we cry," ringing like
the long trumpet blast that sounds for the
charge, they dash forth to victory!<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg&nbsp;205]</a></span>

<p>Adversity had taught David self-restraint,
had braced his soul, had driven
him to grasp firmly the hand of God. And
prosperity had seemed for nearly twenty years
but to perfect the lessons. Gratitude had followed
deliverance, and the sunshine after the
rain had brought out the fragrance of devotion
and the blossoms of glad songs. A good man,
and still more a man of David's age at the date
of his great crime, seldom falls so low, unless
there has been previous, perhaps unconscious,
relaxation of the girded loins, and negligence of
the untrimmed lamp. The sensitive nature of
the psalmist was indeed not unlikely to yield to
the sudden force of such a temptation as conquered
him, but we can scarcely conceive of its
having done so without a previous decay of his
religious life, hidden most likely from himself.
And the source of that decay may probably be
found in self-indulgence, fostered by ease, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg&nbsp;206]</a></span>
by long years of command. The actual fall
into sin seems to have been begun by slothful
abdication of his functions as captain of Israel.
It is perhaps not without bitter emphasis that
the narrative introduces it by telling us that,
"at the time when kings go forth to battle,"
David contented himself with sending his troops
against Ammon, and "tarried still at Jerusalem."
At all events, the story brings into
sharp contrast the levy <i>en masse</i>, encamped
round Rabbath, and their natural head, who had
once been so ready to take his share of blows
and privations, loitering behind, taking his
quiet siesta in the hot hours after noon, as if
there had been no soldiers of his sweltering in
their armour, and rising from his bed to stroll
on his palace roof, and peer into the household
privacies below, as if his heart had no interest
in the grim tussle going on behind the hills
that he could almost see from his height, as
they grew purple in the evening twilight. He
has fallen to the level of an Eastern despot, and
has lost his sense of the responsibilities of his
office. Such loosening of the tension of his
moral nature as is indicated in his absence from
the field, during what was evidently a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg&nbsp;207]</a></span>
severe as well as a long struggle, prepared the
way for the dismal headlong plunge into sin.</p>

<p>The story is told in all its hideousness, without
palliation or reserve, without comment or
heightening, in that stern judicial fashion so
characteristic of the Bible records of its greatest
characters. Every step is narrated without a
trace of softening, and without a word of emotion.
Not a single ugly detail is spared. The
portraiture is as vivid as ever. Bathsheba's willing
complicity, her punctilious observance of
ceremonial propriety while she is trampling
under foot her holiest obligations; the fatal
necessity which drags sin after sin, and summons
up murder to hide, if it be possible, the foul
form of adultery; the stinging rebuke in the conduct
of Uriah, who, Hittite as he was, has a
more chivalrous, not to say devout, shrinking
from personal ease while his comrades and the
ark are in the field, than the king has; the mean
treason, the degradation implied in getting into
Joab's power; the cynical plainness of the
murderous letter, in which a hardened conscience
names his purposed evil by its true name; the
contemptuous measure of his master which
Joab takes in his message, the king's indifference<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg&nbsp;208]</a></span>
to the loss of his men so long as Uriah is out of
the way; the solemn platitudes with which he
pretends to console his tool for the check of his
troops; and the hideous haste with which, after
her scrupulous "mourning" for one week, Bathsheba
threw herself again into David's arms;&mdash;all
these particulars, and every particular an
aggravation, stand out for ever, as men's most
hidden evil will one day do, in the clear, unpitying,
unmistakable light of the Divine record.
What a story it is!</p>

<p>This saint of nearly fifty years of age, bound
to God by ties which he rapturously felt and
acknowledged, whose words have been the very
breath of devotion for every devout heart, forgets
his longings after righteousness, flings
away the joys of Divine communion, darkens
his soul, ends his prosperity, brings down upon
his head for all his remaining years a cataract
of calamities, and makes his name and his religion
a target for the barbed sarcasms of each
succeeding generation of scoffers. "All the
fences and their whole array," which God's
mercies and his own past had reared, "one
cunning sin sweeps quite away." Every obligation
of his office, as every grace of his charac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg&nbsp;209]</a></span>ter,
is trodden under foot by the wild beast
roused in his breast. As man, as king, as
soldier, he is found wanting. Lust and treason,
and craft and murder, are goodly companions
for him who had said, "I will walk within my
house with a perfect heart. I will set no wicked
thing before mine eyes." Why should we dwell
on the wretched story? Because it teaches us,
as no other page in the history of God's church
does, how the alchemy of Divine love can extract
sweet perfumes of penitence and praise out
of the filth of sin; and therefore, though we
turn with loathing from David's sin, we have to
bless God for the record of it, and for the
lessons of hope that come from David's pardon.</p>

<p>To many a sin-tortured soul since then, the
two psalms (li., xxxii.), all blotted with tears, in
which he has sobbed out his penitence, have
been as footsteps in a great and terrible wilderness.
They are too familiar to need, and too
sacred to bear, many words here, but we may
briefly note some points connected with them&mdash;especially
those which assist us in forming
some image of the psalmist's state of mind
after his transgression. It may be observed
that of these two psalms, the fifty-first is evi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg&nbsp;210]</a></span>dently
earlier than the thirty-second. In the
former we see the fallen man struggling up out
of the "horrible pit and miry clay;" in the
latter he stands upon the rock, with a new song
in his mouth, even the blessedness of him
"whose sin is covered." It appears also that
both must be dated after the sharp thrust of
God's lancet which Nathan drove into his conscience,
and the healing balsam of God's assurance
of forgiveness which Nathan laid upon his
heart. The passionate cries of the psalm are
the echo of the Divine promise&mdash;the effort of
his faith to grasp and keep the merciful gift of
pardon. The consciousness of forgiveness is
the basis of the prayer for forgiveness.</p>

<p>Somewhere about a year passed between the
crime and the message of Nathan. And what
sort of a year it was the psalms tell us. The
coarse satisfactions of his sin could not long
content him, as they might have done a lower
type of man. Nobody buys a little passing
pleasure in evil at so dear a rate, or keeps it
for so short a time as a good man. He cannot
make himself as others. "That which cometh
into your mind shall not be at all, in that ye
say, We will be as the families of the nations,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg&nbsp;211]</a></span>
which serve wood and stone." Old habits
quickly reassert their force, conscience soon
lifts again its solemn voice; and while worse
men are enjoying the strong-flavoured meats
on sin's table, the servant of God, who has been
seduced to prefer them for a moment to the
"light bread" from heaven, tastes them already
bitter in his mouth. He may be far from true
repentance, but he will very soon know remorse.
Months may pass before he can feel again the
calm joys of God, but disgust with himself
and with his sin will quickly fill his soul. No
more vivid picture of such a state has ever been
drawn, than is found in the psalms of this period.
They tell of sullen "silence;" dust had settled
on the strings of his harp, as on helmet and
sword. He will not speak to God of his sin,
and there is nothing else that he can speak of.
They tell of his "roaring all the day long"&mdash;the
groan of anguish forced from his yet unsoftened
spirit. Day and night God's heavy
hand weighed him down; the consciousness of
that power, whose gentleness had once holden
him up, crushed, but did not melt him. Like
some heated iron, its heaviness scorched as well
as bruised, and his moisture&mdash;all the dew and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg&nbsp;212]</a></span>
freshness of his life&mdash;was dried up at its touch
and turned into dusty, cracking drought, that
chaps the hard earth, and shrinks the streamlets,
and burns to brown powder the tender herbage
(Ps. xxxii.). Body and mind seem both to be
included in this wonderful description, in which
obstinate dumbness, constant torture, dread of
God, and not one softening drop of penitence
fill the dry and dusty heart, while "bones waxing
old," or, as the word might be rendered,
"rotting," sleepless nights, and perhaps the
burning heat of disease, are hinted at as the
accompaniments of the soul-agony. It is possible
that similar allusions to actual bodily
illness are to be found in another psalm, probably
referring to the same period, and presenting
striking parallelisms of expression (Ps. vi.),
"Have mercy upon me, Jehovah, for I languish
(fade away); heal me, for my bones are
affrighted. My soul is also sore vexed. I
am weary with my groaning; every night
make I my bed to swim. I water my couch
with my tears." The similar phrase, too, in
psalm fifty-one, "The bones which Thou hast
broken," may have a similar application. Thus,
sick in body and soul, he dragged through a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg&nbsp;213]</a></span>
weary year&mdash;ashamed of his guilty dalliance,
wretched in his self-accusations, afraid of God,
and skulking in the recesses of his palace from
the sight of his people. A goodly price he had
sold integrity for. The bread had been sweet
for a moment, but how quickly his "mouth is
filled with gravel" (Proverbs xx. 17). David
learned, what we all learn (and the holier a
man is, the more speedily and sharply does
the lesson follow on the heels of his sin), that
every transgression is a blunder, that we never
get the satisfaction which we expect from any
sin, or if we do, we get something with it which
spoils it all. A nauseous drug is added to the
exciting, intoxicating drink which temptation
offers, and though its flavour is at first disguised
by the pleasanter taste of the sin, its bitterness
is persistent though slow, and clings to the
palate long after that has faded utterly.</p>

<p>Into this dreary life Nathan's message comes
with merciful rebuke. The prompt severity of
David's judgment against the selfish sinner of
the inimitable apologue may be a subtle indication
of his troubled conscience, which fancies
some atonement for his own sin in stern repression
of that of others; for consciousness of evil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg&nbsp;214]</a></span>
may sometimes sting into harshness as well as
soften to lenity, and sinful man is a sterner
judge than the righteous God. The answer of
Nathan is a perfect example of the Divine way
of convincing of sin. There is first the plain
charge pressed home on the individual conscience,
"Thou art the man." Then follows,
not reproach nor further deepening of the
blackness of the deed, but a tender enumeration
of God's great benefits, whereon is built
the solemn question, "Wherefore hast thou
despised the commandment of the Lord, to
do evil in His sight?" The contemplation of
God's faithful love, and of the all-sufficient gifts
which it bestows, makes every transgression
irrational as well as ungrateful, and turns remorse,
which consumes like the hot wind of
the wilderness, into tearful repentance which
refreshes the soul. When God has been seen
loving and bestowing ere He commands and
requires, it is profitable to hold the image of
the man's evil in all its ugliness close up to his
eyes; and so the bald facts are repeated next
in the fewest, strongest words. Nor can the
message close until a rigid law of retribution
has been proclaimed, the slow operation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg&nbsp;215]</a></span>
which will filter bitterness and shame through
all his life. "And David said unto Nathan,
I have sinned against the Lord." Two words
(in the Hebrew) make the transition from
sullen misery to real though shaded peace.
No lengthened outpouring, no accumulation
of self-reproach; he is too deeply moved for
many words, which he knows God does not
need. More would have been less. All is contained
in that one sob, in which the whole
frostwork of these weary months breaks up
and rolls away, swept before the strong flood.
And as brief and simple as the confession, is
the response, "And Nathan said unto David,
The Lord also hath put away thy sin." How
full and unconditional the blessing bestowed
in these few words; how swift and sufficient
the answer! So the long estrangement is
ended. Thus simple and Divine is the manner
of pardon. In such short compass may the
turning point of a life lie! But while confession
and forgiveness heal the breach between
God and David, pardon is not impunity, and
the same sentence which bestows the remission
of sin announces the exaction of a penalty.
The judgments threatened a moment before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg&nbsp;216]</a></span>&mdash;a
moment so far removed now to David's consciousness
that it would look as if an age had
passed&mdash;are not withdrawn, and another is
added, the death of Bathsheba's infant. God
loves His servants too well to "suffer sin upon
them," and the freest forgiveness and the
happiest consciousness of it may consist with
the loving infliction and the submissive bearing
of pains, which are no longer the strokes of an
avenging judge, but the chastisements of a
gracious father.</p>

<p>The fifty-first psalm must, we think, be conceived
of as following soon after Nathan's
mission. There may be echoes of the prophet's
stern question, "Wherefore hast thou despised
the commandment of the Lord, to do evil in
His sight?" and of the confession, "I have
sinned against the Lord," in the words, "Against
Thee, Thee only have I sinned, and done evil
in Thy sight" (ver. 4), though perhaps the
expressions are not so peculiar as to make
the allusion certain. But, at all events, the
penitence and prayers of the psalm can scarcely
be supposed to have preceded the date of the
historical narrative, which clearly implies that
the rebuke of the seer was the first thing that
broke up the dumb misery of unrepented sin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg&nbsp;217]</a></span></p>

<p>Although the psalm is one long cry for
pardon and restoration, one can discern an
order and progress in its petitions&mdash;the order,
not of an artificial reproduction of a past mood
of mind, but the instinctive order in which the
emotion of contrite desire will ever pour itself
forth. In the psalm all begins, as all begins in
fact, with the grounding of the cry for favour
on "Thy loving-kindness," "the multitude of
Thy tender mercies;" the one plea that avails
with God, whose love is its own motive and its
own measure, whose past acts are the standard
for all His future, whose compassions, in their
innumerable numbers, are more than the sum
of our transgressions, though these be "more
than the hairs of our head." Beginning
with God's mercy, the penitent soul can
learn to look next upon its own sin
in all its aspects of evil. The depth and
intensity of the psalmist's loathing of self is
wonderfully expressed in his words for his
crime. He speaks of his "transgressions" and
of his "sin." Looked at in one way, he sees
the separate acts of which he had been guilty&mdash;lust,
fraud, treachery, murder: looked at in
another, he sees them all knotted together, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg&nbsp;218]</a></span>
one inextricable tangle of forked, hissing
tongues, like the serpent locks that coil and
twist round a Gorgon head. No sin dwells
alone; the separate acts have a common root,
and the whole is matted together like the green
growth on a stagnant pond, so that, by whatever
filament it is grasped, the whole mass is drawn
towards you. And a profound insight into the
essence and character of sin lies in the accumulated
synonyms. It is "transgression," or, as
the word might be rendered, "rebellion"&mdash;not
the mere breach of an impersonal law, not
merely an infraction of "the constitution of our
nature"&mdash;but the rising of a subject will against
its true king, disobedience to a person as well as
contravention of a standard. It is "iniquity"&mdash;perversion
or distortion&mdash;a word which expresses
the same metaphor as is found in many languages,
namely, crookedness as descriptive of
deeds which depart from the perfect line of right.
It is "sin," <i>i.e.</i>, "missing one's aim;" in which
profound word is contained the truth that all
sin is a blunder, shooting wide of the true goal,
if regard be had to the end of our being, and not
less wide if regard be had to our happiness. It
ever misses the mark; and the epitaph might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg&nbsp;219]</a></span>
be written over every sinner who seeks pleasure
at the price of righteousness, "Thou fool."</p>

<p>Nor less pregnant with meaning is the psalmist's
emphatic acknowledgment, "Against Thee,
Thee only have I sinned." He is not content
with looking upon his evil in itself, or in relation
only to the people who had suffered by it; he
thinks of it in relation to God. He had been
guilty of crimes against Bathsheba and Uriah,
and even the rough soldier whom he made his
tool, as well as against his whole subjects; but,
dark as these were, they assumed their true
character only when they were discerned as done
against God. "Sin," in its full sense, implies
"God" as its correlative. We transgress against
each other, but we sin against Him.</p>

<p>Nor does the psalmist stop here. He has
acknowledged the tangled multiplicity and
dreadful unity of his evil, he has seen its inmost
character, he has learned to bring his deed into
connection with God; what remains still to be
confessed? He laments, and that not as extenuation
(though it be explanation), but as
aggravation, the sinful nature in which he had
been born. The deeds had come from a source&mdash;a
bitter fountain had welled out this blackness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg&nbsp;220]</a></span>
He himself is evil, therefore he has done evil.
The sin is his; he will not contest his full responsibility;
and its foul characteristics declare
the inward foulness from which it has flowed&mdash;and
that foulness is himself. Does he therefore
think that he is less to blame? By no means.
His acknowledgment of an evil nature is the
very deepest of his confessions, and leads not to
a palliation of his guilt, but to a cry to Him who
alone can heal the inward wound; and as He
can purge away the transgressions, can likewise
stanch their source, and give him to feel within
"that he is healed from that plague."</p>

<p>The same intensity of feeling expressed
by the use of so many words for sin is
revealed also in the reiterated synonyms
for pardon. The prayer comes from his
lips over and over again, not because he
thinks that he shall be heard for his much
speaking, but because of the earnestness of his
longing. Such repetitions are signs of the persistence
of faith, while others, though they last
like the prayers of Baal's priests, "from morning
till the time of the evening sacrifice," indicate
only the suppliant's doubt. David prays that
his sins may be "blotted out," in which petition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg&nbsp;221]</a></span>
they are conceived as recorded against him in
the archives of the heavens; that he may be
"washed" from them, in which they are conceived
as foul stains upon himself, needing for
their removal hard rubbing and beating (for
such is, according to some commentators, the
force of the word); that he may be "cleansed"&mdash;the
technical word for the priestly cleansing
of the leper, and declaring him clear of the
taint. He also, with similar recurrence to the
Mosaic symbols, prays that he may be "purged
with hyssop." There is a pathetic appropriateness
in the petition, for not only lepers, but
those who had become defiled by contact
with a dead body, were thus purified; and on
whom did the taint of corruption cleave as on
the murderer of Uriah? The prayer, too, is
even more remarkable in the original, which
employs a verb formed from the word for
"sin;" "and if in our language that were a
word in use, it might be translated, 'Thou shalt
un-sin me.'"<a name="FNanchor_W_23" id="FNanchor_W_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_W_23" id="Footnote_W_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_W_23"><span class="label">[W]</span></a> Donne's Sermons, quoted in Perowne, <i>in. loc.</i></p></div>

<p>In the midst of these abased confessions and
cries for pardon there comes with wonderful
force and beauty the bold prayer for restoration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg&nbsp;222]</a></span>
to "joy and gladness"&mdash;an indication surely of
more than ordinary confidence in the full mercy
of God, which would efface all the consequences
of his sin.</p>

<p>And following upon them are petitions for
sanctifying, reiterated and many-sided, like
those that have preceded. Three pairs of
clauses contain these, in each of which the
second member of the clause asks for the infusion
into his spirit of some grace from God&mdash;that
he may possess a "steadfast spirit," "Thy
Holy Spirit," "a willing spirit." It is perhaps
not an accident that the central petition of the
three is the one which most clearly expresses
the thought which all imply&mdash;that the human
spirit can only be renewed and hallowed by
the entrance into it of the Divine. We are not
to commit the theological anachronism which
has been applied with such evil effect to the
whole Old Testament, and suppose that David
meant by that central clause in his prayer for
renewal all that we mean by it; but he meant,
at least, that his spiritual nature could be made
to love righteousness and hate iniquity by none
other power than God's breathing on it. If we
may venture to regard this as the heart of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg&nbsp;223]</a></span>
series, the other two on either side of it may be
conceived as its consequences. It will then be
"a right spirit," or, as the word means, a steadfast
spirit, strong to resist, not swept away by
surges of passion, nor shaken by terrors of remorse,
but calm, tenacious, and resolved, pressing
on in the path of holiness, and immovable
with the immobility of those who are rooted in
God and goodness. It will be a free, or "a
willing spirit," ready for all joyful service of
thankfulness, and so penetrated with the love of
his God that he will delight to do His will, and
carry the law charactered in the spontaneous
impulses of his renewed nature. Not without
profound meaning does the psalmist seem to
recur in his hour of penitence to the tragic fate
of his predecessor in the monarchy, to whom, as
to himself, had been given by the same anointing,
the same gift of "the Spirit of God." Remembering
how the holy chrism had faded from
the raven locks of Saul long before his bloody
head had been sent round Philistine cities to
glut their revenge, and knowing that if God
were "strict to mark iniquity," the gift which
had been withdrawn from Saul would not be
continued to himself, he prays, not as anointed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg&nbsp;224]</a></span>
monarch only, but as sinful man, "Take not
Thy Holy Spirit from me." As before he had
ventured to ask for the joy of forgiveness, so
now he pleads once more for "the joy of Thy
salvation," which comes from cleansing, from
conscious fellowship&mdash;which he had so long and
deeply felt, which for so many months had been
hid from him by the mists of his own sin. The
psalmist's natural buoyancy, the gladness which
was an inseparable part of his religion, and had
rung from his harp in many an hour of peril,
the bold width of his desires, grounded on the
clear breadth of his faith in God's perfect forgiveness,
are all expressed in such a prayer
from such lips at such a time, and may well be
pondered and imitated by us.</p>

<p>The lowly prayer which we have been tracing
rises ere its close to a vow of renewed praise. It
is very beautiful to note how the poet nature, as
well as the consciousness of a Divine function,
unite in the resolve that crowns the psalm. To
David no tribute that he could bring to God
seemed so little unworthy&mdash;none to himself so
joyous&mdash;as the music of his harp, and the melody
of his songs; nor was any part of his kingly
office so lofty in his estimation as his calling to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg&nbsp;225]</a></span>
proclaim in glowing words the name of the
Lord, that men might learn to love. His
earliest song in exile had closed with a like
vow. It had been well fulfilled for many a
year; but these last doleful months had silenced
all his praise. Now, as hope begins to shine
upon him once more, the frost which had stilled
the stream of his devotion is melting, and as he
remembers his glad songs of old, and this
miserable dumbness, his final prayer is, "O
Lord, open Thou my lips, and my mouth shall
show forth Thy praise."</p>

<p>The same consciousness of sin, which we have
found in a previous verse discerning the true
significance of ceremonial purification, leads
also to the recognition of the insufficiency of
outward sacrifices&mdash;a thought which is not, as
some modern critics would fain make it, the
product of the latest age of Judaism, but appears
occasionally through the whole of the history,
and indicates not the date, but the spiritual
elevation of its utterer. David sets it on the very
summit of his psalm, to sparkle there like some
stone of price. The rich jewel which he has
brought up from the abyss of degradation is
that truth which has shone out from its setting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg&nbsp;226]</a></span>
here over three millenniums: "The sacrifices of
God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite
heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise."</p>

<p>The words which follow, containing a prayer
for the building up of Zion, and a prediction of
the continuous offering of sacrifice, present some
difficulty. They do not necessarily presuppose
that Jerusalem is in ruins; for "build Thou the
walls" would be no less appropriate a petition
if the fortifications were unfinished (as we know
they were in David's time) than if they had
been broken down. Nor do the words contradict
the view of sacrifice just given, for the use
of the symbol and the conviction of its insufficiency
co-existed, in fact, in every devout
life, and may well be expressed side by
side. But the transition from so intensely
personal emotions to intercession for Zion
seems almost too sudden even for a nature
as wide and warm as David's. If the closing
verses are his, we may, indeed, see in
them the king re-awaking to a sense of his
responsibilities, which he had so long neglected,
first, in the selfishness of his heart, and then in
the morbid self-absorption of his remorse; and
the lesson may be a precious one that the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg&nbsp;227]</a></span>
thought of a pardoned man should be for others.
But there is much to be said, on the other hand,
in favour of the conjecture that these verses are
a later addition, probably after the return from
captivity, when the walls of Zion were in ruins,
and the altar of the temple had been long cold.
If so, then our psalm, as it came from David's
full heart, would be all of a piece&mdash;one great
gush of penitence and faith, beginning with,
"Have mercy upon me, O God," ending with
the assurance of acceptance, and so remaining
for all ages the chart of the thorny and yet
blessed path that leads "from death unto life."
In that aspect, what it does not contain is as
noteworthy as what it does. Not one word asks
for exemption from such penalties of his great
fall as can be inflicted by a loving Father on a
soul that lives in His love. He cries for pardon,
but he gives his back to the smiters whom God
may please to send.</p>

<p>The other psalm of the penitent (xxxii.) has
been already referred to in connection with the
autobiographical materials which it contains. It
is evidently of a later period than the fifty-first.
There is no struggle in it; the prayer has been
heard, and this is the beginning of the fulfilment of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg&nbsp;228]</a></span>
the vow to show forth God's praise. In the earlier
he had said, "Then will I teach transgressors the
way;" here he says, "I will instruct thee and
teach thee in the way which thou shalt go."
There he began with the plaintive cry for mercy;
here with a burst of praise celebrating the
happiness of the pardoned penitent. There we
heard the sobs of a man in the very agony of
abasement; here we have the story of their
blessed issue. There we had multiplied synonyms
for sin, and for the forgiveness which was
desired; here it is the many-sided preciousness
of forgiveness possessed which runs over in
various yet equivalent phrases. There the
highest point to which he could climb was the
assurance that a bruised heart was accepted,
and the bones broken might still rejoice. Here
the very first word is of blessedness, and the
close summons the righteous to exuberant joy.
The one is a psalm of wailing; the other, to use
its own words, a "song of deliverance."</p>

<p>What glad consciousness that he himself is
the happy man whom he describes rings in the
melodious variations of the one thought of
forgiveness in the opening words! How gratefully
he draws on the treasures of that recent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg&nbsp;229]</a></span>
experience, while he sets it forth as being the
"taking away" of sin, as if it were the removal
of a solid something, or the lifting of a burden off
his back; and as the "covering" of sin, as if it
were the wrapping of its ugliness in thick folds
that hide it for ever even from the all-seeing
Eye; and as the "non-reckoning" of sin, as if it
were the discharge of a debt! What vivid
memory of past misery in the awful portrait of
his impenitent self, already referred to&mdash;on
which the mind dwells in silence, while the
musical accompaniment (as directed by the
"selah") touches some plaintive minor or
grating discord! How noble and eloquent
the brief words (echo of the historical narrative)
that tell the full and swift forgiveness
that followed simple confession&mdash;and how
effectively the music again comes in, prolonging
the thought and rejoicing in the pardon!
How sure he is that his experience is of
priceless value to the world for all time,
when he sees in his absolution a motive that
will draw all the godly nearer to their Helper
in heaven! How full his heart is of praise,
that he cannot but go back again to his own
story, and rejoice in God his hiding-place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg&nbsp;230]</a></span>&mdash;whose
past wondrous love assures him that in
the future songs of deliverance will ring him
round, and all his path be encompassed with
music of praise.</p>

<p>So ends the more personal part of the psalm.
A more didactic portion follows, the generalization
of that. Possibly the voice which now
speaks is a higher than David's. "I will instruct
thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt
go. I will guide thee with mine eye," scarcely
sounds like words meant to be understood as
spoken by him. They are the promise from
heaven of a gentle teaching to the pardoned
man, which will instruct by no severity, but by
patient schooling; which will direct by no harsh
authority, but by that loving glance that is
enough for those who love, and is all too subtle
and delicate to be perceived by any other.
Such gracious direction is not for the psalmist
alone, but it needs a spirit in harmony with
God to understand it. For others there can be
nothing higher than mere force, the discipline
of sorrow, the bridle in the hard mouth, the
whip for the stiff back. The choice for all men
is through penitence and forgiveness to rise to
the true position of men, capable of receiving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg&nbsp;231]</a></span>
and obeying a spiritual guidance, which appeals
to the heart, and gently subdues the will, or by
stubborn impenitence to fall to the level of
brutes, that can only be held in by a halter and
driven by a lash. And because this is the
alternative, therefore "Many sorrows shall be to
the wicked; but he that trusteth in the Lord,
mercy shall compass him about."</p>

<p>And then the psalm ends with a great cry of
gladness, three times reiterated, like the voice
of a herald on some festal day of a nation:
"Rejoice in Jehovah! and leap for joy, O
righteous! and gladly shout, all ye upright in
heart!"</p>

<p>Such is the end of the sobs of the penitent.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h2 class="space"><a name="CHASTISE" id="CHASTISE"></a>XIV.&mdash;CHASTISEMENTS.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg&nbsp;232]</a></span>

<p>The chastisements, which were the natural
fruits of David's sin, soon began to show
themselves, though apparently ten years at least
passed before Absalom's revolt, at which time
he was probably a man of sixty. But these ten
years were very weary and sad. There is no
more joyous activity, no more conquering
energy, no more consciousness of his people's
love. Disasters thicken round him, and may
all be traced to his great sin. His children
learned the lesson it had taught them, and lust
and fratricide desolated his family. A parent
can have no sharper pang than the sight of his
own sins reappearing in his child. David saw
the ghastly reflection of his unbridled passion
in his eldest son's foul crime (and even a gleam
of it in his unhappy daughter), and of his
murderous craft in his second son's bloody
revenge. Whilst all this hell of crime is boiling
round him, a strange passiveness seems to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg&nbsp;233]</a></span>
crept over the king, and to have continued till
his flight before Absalom. The narrative is
singularly silent about him. He seems paralysed
by the consciousness of his past sin; he
originates nothing. He dares not punish Ammon;
he can only weep when he hears of
Absalom's crime. He weakly longs for the
return of the latter from his exile, but cannot
nerve himself to send for him till Joab urges it.
A flash of his old kingliness blazes out for a
moment in his refusal to see his son; but even
that slight satisfaction to justice vanishes as
soon as Joab chooses to insist that Absalom
shall return to court. He seems to have no
will of his own. He has become a mere tool in
the hands of his fierce general&mdash;and Joab's hold
upon him was his complicity in Uriah's murder.
Thus at every step he was dogged by the consequences
of his crime, even though it was
pardoned sin. And if, as is probable, Ahithophel
was Bathsheba's grandfather, the most
formidable person in Absalom's conspiracy,
whose defection wounded him so deeply, was
no doubt driven to the usurper's side out of
revenge for the insult to his house in her person.
Thus "of our pleasant vices doth heaven make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg&nbsp;234]</a></span>
whips to scourge us." "Be not deceived; whatsoever
a man soweth, that shall he also reap."</p>

<p>It is not probable that many psalms were
made in those dreary days. But the forty-first
and fifty-fifth are, with reasonable probability,
referred to this period by many commentators.
They give a very touching picture of the old
king during the four years in which Absalom's
conspiracy was being hatched. It seems, from
the forty-first, that the pain and sorrow of his
heart had brought on some serious illness, which
his enemies had used for their own purposes,
and embittered by hypocritical condolences and
ill-concealed glee. The sensitive nature of
the psalmist winces under their heartless desertion
of him, and pours out its plaint in this
pathetic lament. He begins with a blessing on
those who "consider the afflicted"&mdash;having
reference, perhaps, to the few who were faithful
to him in his languishing sickness. He passes
thence to his own case, and, after humble confession
of his sin,&mdash;almost in the words of the
fifty-first psalm,&mdash;he tells how his sickbed had
been surrounded by very different visitors. His
disease drew no pity, but only fierce impatience
that he lingered in life so long. "Mine enemies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg&nbsp;235]</a></span>
speak evil of me&mdash;when will he die, and his
name have perished?" One of them, in
especial, who must have been a man in
high position to gain access to the sick
chamber, has been conspicuous by his lying
words of condolence: "If he come to see me
he speaketh vanity." The sight of the sick king
touched no chord of affection, but only increased
the traitor's animosity&mdash;"his heart gathereth
evil to itself"&mdash;and then, having watched his
pale face for wished-for unfavourable symptoms,
the false friend hurries from the bedside to talk
of his hopeless illness&mdash;"he goeth abroad, he
telleth it." The tidings spread, and are
stealthily passed from one conspirator to
another. "All that hate me whisper together
against me." They exaggerate the gravity of
his condition, and are glad because, making the
wish the father to the thought, they believe him
dying. "A thing of Belial" (<i>i.e.</i>, a destructive
disease), "say they, is poured out upon him,
and now that he lieth, he shall rise up no more."
And, sharpest pang of all, that among these
traitors, and probably the same person as he
whose heartless presence in the sick chamber
was so hard to bear, should be Ahithophel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg&nbsp;236]</a></span>
whose counsel had been like an oracle from
God. Even he, "the man of my friendship, in
whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread"&mdash;he,
like an ignoble, vicious mule&mdash;"has lifted
high his heel" against the sick lion.</p>

<p>We should be disposed to refer the thirty-ninth
psalm also to this period. It, too, is the
meditation of one in sickness, which he knows
to be a Divine judgment for his sin. There is
little trace of enemies in it; but his attitude is
that of silent submission, while wicked men are
disquieted around him&mdash;which is precisely the
characteristic peculiarity of his conduct at this
period. It consists of two parts (vers. 1-6 and
7-13), in both of which the subjects of his
meditations are the same, but the tone of them
different. His own sickness and mortality, and
man's fleeting, shadowy life, are his themes.
The former has led him to think of the latter.
The first effect of his sorrow was to close his
lips in a silence that was not altogether submission.
"I held my peace, even from good, and
my sorrow was stirred." As in his sin, when he
kept silence, his "bones waxed old," so now in
his sorrow and sickness the pain that could not
find expression raged the more violently. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg&nbsp;237]</a></span>
tearless eyes were hot and aching; but he conquered
the dumb spirit, and could carry his
heavy thoughts to God. They are very heavy
at first. He only desires that the sad truth
may be driven deeper into his soul. With the
engrossment so characteristic of melancholy, he
asks, what might have been thought the thing
he needed least, "Make me to know mine end;"
and then he dilates on the gloomy reflections
which he had been cherishing in silence. Not
only he himself, with his handbreadth of days,
that shrink into absolute nothingness when
brought into contrast with the life of God, but
"every man," even when apparently "standing"
most "firm, is only a breath." As a shadow
every man moves spectral among shadows.
The tumult that fills their lives is madness;
"only for a breath are they disquieted." So
bitterly, with an anticipation of the sad, clear-eyed
pity and scorn of "The Preacher," does
the sick and wearied king speak, in tones very
unlike the joyous music of his earlier utterances.</p>

<p>But, true and wholesome as such thoughts
are, they are not all the truth. So the prayer
changes in tone, even while its substance is the
same. He rises from the shows of earth to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg&nbsp;238]</a></span>
true home, driven thither by their hollowness.
"My hope is in Thee." The conviction of earth's
vanity is all different when it has "tossed him
to Thy breast." The pardoned sinner, who
never thereafter forgot his grievous fall, asks for
deliverance "from all his transgressions." The
sullen silence has changed into full acquiescence:
"I opened not my mouth, because Thou
didst it,"&mdash;a silence differing from the other as
the calm after the storm, when all the winds
sleep and the sun shines out on a freshened
world, differs from the boding stillness while
the slow thunder-clouds grow lurid on the
horizon. He cries for healing, for he knows his
sickness to be the buffet and assault of God's
hand; and its bitterness is assuaged, even while
its force continues, by the conviction that it is
God's fatherly chastisement for sin which gnaws
away his manly vigour as the moth frets his
kingly robe. The very thought which had been
so bitter&mdash;that every man is vanity&mdash;reappears
in a new connection as the basis of the prayer
that God would hear, and is modified so as to
become infinitely blessed and hopeful. "I
am a stranger with Thee, and a sojourner, as
all my fathers were." A wanderer indeed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg&nbsp;239]</a></span>
and a transient guest on earth; but what of
that, if he be God's guest? All that is sorrowful
is drawn off from the thought when we
realise our connection with God. We are in
God's house; the host, not the guest, is responsible
for the housekeeping. We need not feel life
lonely if He be with us, nor its shortness sad.
It is not a shadow, a dream, a breath, if it
be rooted in Him. And thus the sick man has
conquered his gloomy thoughts, even though he
sees little before him but the end; and he is not
cast down even though his desires are all summed
up in one for a little respite and healing, ere the
brief trouble of earth be done with: "O spare me,
that I may recover strength before I go hence,
and be no more."</p>

<p>It may be observed that this supposition of a
protracted illness, which is based upon these
psalms, throws light upon the singular passiveness
of David during the maturing of Absalom's
conspiracy, and may naturally be supposed to
have favoured his schemes, an essential part of
which was to ingratiate himself with suitors who
came to the king for judgment by affecting
great regret that no man was deputed of the
king to hear them. The accumulation of untried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg&nbsp;240]</a></span>
causes, and the apparent disorganization of the
judicial machinery, are well accounted for by
David's sickness.</p>

<p>The fifty-fifth psalm gives some very
pathetic additional particulars. It is in three
parts&mdash;a plaintive prayer and portraiture of the
psalmist's mental distress (vers. 1-8); a
vehement supplication against his foes, and
indignant recounting of their treachery (vers.
9-16); and, finally, a prophecy of the retribution
that is to fall upon them (vers. 17-23).
In the first and second portions we have some
points which help to complete our picture of the
man. For instance, his heart "writhes" within
him, the "terrors of death" are on him, "fear
and trembling" are come on him, and "horror"
has covered him. All this points, like subsequent
verses, to his knowledge of the conspiracy before
it came to a head. The state of the city, which
is practically in the hands of Absalom and his
tools, is described with bold imagery. Violence
and Strife in possession of it, spies prowling
about the walls day and night, Evil and Trouble
in its midst, and Destruction, Oppression, and
Deceit&mdash;a goodly company&mdash;flaunting in its
open spaces. And the spirit, the brain of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg&nbsp;241]</a></span>
whole, is the trusted friend whom he had made
his own equal, who had shared his secretest
thoughts in private, who had walked next him
in solemn processions to the temple. Seeing all
this, what does the king do, who was once so
fertile in resource, so decisive in counsel, so
prompt in action? Nothing. His only weapon
is prayer. "As for me, I will call upon God;
and the Lord will save me. Evening, and
morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud:
and He shall hear my voice." He lets it all
grow as it list, and only longs to be out of all
the weary coil of troubles. "Oh that I had
wings like a dove, then would I fly away and be
at rest. Lo, I would flee far off, I would lodge
in the wilderness. I would swiftly fly to my
refuge from the raging wind, from the tempest."
The langour of his disease, love for his worthless
son, consciousness of sin, and submission to the
chastisement through "one of his own house,"
which Nathan had foretold, kept him quiet, though
he saw the plot winding its meshes round him.
And in this submission patient confidence is not
wanting, though subdued and saddened, which
finds expression in the last words of this psalm of
the heavy laden, "Cast thy burden upon Jehovah.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg&nbsp;242]</a></span>
He, He will sustain thee.... I will trust in
Thee."</p>

<p>When the blow at last fell, the same passive
acquiescence in what he felt to be God's chastisement
is very noticeable. Absalom escapes
to Hebron, and sets up the standard of revolt.
When the news comes to Jerusalem the king's
only thought is immediate flight. He is almost
cowardly in his eagerness to escape, and is
prepared to give up everything without a blow.
It seems as if only a touch was needed to overthrow
his throne. He hurries on the preparations
for flight with nervous haste. He forms no
plans beyond those of his earlier wish to fly
away and be at rest. He tries to denude himself
of followers. When the six hundred men of
Gath&mdash;who had been with him ever since his
early days in Philistia, and had grown grey in
his service&mdash;make themselves the van of his
little army, he urges the heroic Ittai, their
leader, to leave him a fugitive, and to worship
the rising sun, "Return to thy place, and abide
with <i>the king</i>"&mdash;so thoroughly does he regard
the crown as passed already from his brows.
The priests with the ark are sent back; he is not
worthy to have the symbol of the Divine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg&nbsp;243]</a></span>
presence identified with his doubtful cause, and
is prepared to submit without a murmur if God
"thus say, I have no delight in thee." With
covered head and naked feet he goes up the
slope of Olivet, and turning perhaps at that same
bend in the rocky mountain path where the true
King, coming to the city, wept as he saw its
shining walls and soaring pinnacles across the
narrow valley, the discrowned king and all his
followers broke into passionate weeping as they
gazed their last on the lost capital, and then
with choking sobs rounded the shoulder of the
hill and set their faces to their forlorn flight.
Passing through the territory of Saul's tribe&mdash;dangerous
ground for him to tread&mdash;the rank
hatred of Shimei's heart blossoms into speech.
With Eastern vehemence, he curses and flings
stones and dust in the transports of his fury,
stumbling along among the rocks high up on the
side of the glen, as he keeps abreast of the little
band below. Did David remember how the
husband from whom he had torn Michal had
followed her to this very place, and there had
turned back weeping to his lonely home? The
remembrance, at any rate, of later and more evil
deeds prompted his meek answer, "Let him
curse, for the Lord hath bidden him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg&nbsp;244]</a></span></p>

<p>The first force of the disaster spent itself, and
by the time he was safe across Jordan, on the
free uplands of Bashan, his spirit rises. He
makes a stand at Mahanaim, the place where
his great ancestor, in circumstances somewhat
analogous to his own, had seen the vision of
"bright-harnessed angels" ranked in battle array
for the defence of himself and his own little
band, and called the name of the place the "two
camps." Perhaps that old story helped to
hearten him, as the defection of Ahithophel from
the conspiracy certainly would do. As the time
went on, too, it became increasingly obvious
that the leaders of the rebellion were "infirm of
purpose," and that every day of respite from
actual fighting diminished their chances of
success, as that politic adviser saw so plainly.
Whatever may have been the reason, it is clear
that by the time David had reached Mahanaim
he had resolved not to yield without a struggle.
He girds on his sword once more with some of
the animation of early days, and the light of
trustful valour blazes again in his old eyes.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<hr />

<h2 class="space"><a name="SONGS" id="SONGS"></a>XV. THE SONGS OF THE FUGITIVE.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg&nbsp;245]</a></span>

<p>The psalms which probably belong to the
period of Absalom's rebellion correspond
well with the impression of his spirit gathered
from the historical books. Confidence in God,
submission to His will, are strongly expressed in
them, and we may almost discern a progress in
the former respect as the rebellion grows. They
flame brighter and brighter in the deepening
darkness. From the lowest abyss the stars
are seen most clearly. He is far more buoyant
when he is an exile once more in the wilderness,
and when the masks of plot and trickery are
fallen, and the danger stands clear before him.
Like some good ship issuing from the shelter
of the pier heads, the first blow of the waves
throws her over on her side and makes her
quiver like a living thing recoiling from a terror,
but she rises above the tossing surges and keeps
her course. We may allocate with a fair amount
of likelihood the following psalms to this period<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg&nbsp;246]</a></span>&mdash;iii.;
iv.; xxv. (?); xxviii. (?); lviii. (?); lxi.;
lxii.; lxiii.; cix. (?); cxliii.</p>

<p>The first two of these form a pair; they are
a morning and an evening hymn. The little
band are encamped on their road to Mahanaim,
with no roof but the stars, and no walls but the
arm of God. In the former the discrowned
king sings, as he rises from his nightly bivouac.
He pours out first his plaint of the foes, who
are described as "many," and as saying that,
"There is no help for him in God," words which
fully correspond to the formidable dimensions
of the revolt, and to the belief which actuated
the conspirators, and had appeared as possible
even to himself, that his sin had turned away
the aid of heaven from his cause. To such
utterances of malice and confident hatred he
opposes the conviction which had again filled
his soul, that even in the midst of real peril and
the shock of battle Jehovah is his "shield."
With bowed and covered head he had fled from
Jerusalem, but "Thou art the lifter up of mine
head." He was an exile from the tabernacle
on Zion, and he had sent back the ark to its
rest; but though he has to cry to God from
beyond Jordan, He answers "from His holy hill."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg&nbsp;247]</a></span>
He and his men camped amidst dangers, but
one unslumbering Helper mounted guard over
their undefended slumbers. "I laid me down
and slept" there among the echoes of the hills.
"I awaked, for Jehovah sustained me;" and
another night has passed without the sudden
shout of the rebels breaking the silence, or the
gleam of their swords in the starlight. The
experience of protection thus far heartens him
to front even the threatening circle of his foes
around him, whom it is his pain to think of as
"the people" of God, and yet as his foes. And
then he betakes himself in renewed energy of
faith to his one weapon of prayer, and even
before the battle sees the victory, and the
Divine power fracturing the jaws and breaking
the teeth of the wild beasts who hunt him. But
his last thought is not of retribution nor of fear;
for himself he rises to the height of serene trust,
"Salvation is of the Lord;" and for his foes
and for all the nation that had risen against
him his thoughts are worthy of a true king,
freed from all personal animosity, and his
words are a prayer conceived in the spirit of
Him whose dying breath was intercession for
His rebellious subjects who crucified their King,
"Thy blessing be upon Thy people."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg&nbsp;248]</a></span></p>

<p>The fourth psalm is the companion evening
hymn. Its former portion (vers. 2-4) seems to
be a remonstrance addressed as if to the leaders
of the revolt ("sons of men" being equivalent
to "persons of rank and dignity"). It is the
expression in vivid form, most natural to such
a nature, of his painful feeling under their
slanders; and also of his hopes and desires for
them, that calm thought in these still evening
hours which are falling on the world may lead
them to purer service and to reliance on God.
So forgivingly, so lovingly does he think of
them, ere he lays himself down to rest, wishing
that "on their beds," as on his, the peace of
meditative contemplation may rest, and the
day of war's alarms be shut in by holy "communion
with their own hearts" and with God.</p>

<p>The second portion turns to himself and
his followers, among whom we may suppose
some faint hearts were beginning to
despond; and to them, as to the very enemy,
David would fain be the bringer of a better
mind. "Many say, Who will show us
good?" He will turn them from their vain
search round the horizon on a level with their
own eyes for the appearance of succour. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg&nbsp;249]</a></span>
must look upwards, not round about. They
must turn their question, which only expects a
negative answer, into a prayer, fashioned like
that triple priestly benediction of old (Numbers
vi. 24-26). His own experience bursts forth
irrepressible. He had prayed in his hour of
penitence, "Make me to hear joy and gladness"
(Psa. li.); and the prayer had been answered, if
not before, yet now when peril had brought
him nearer to God, and trust had drawn God
nearer to him. In his calamity, as is ever the
case with devout souls, his joy increased, as
Greek fire burns more brightly under water.
Therefore this pauper sovereign, discrowned
and fed by the charity of the Gileadite pastoral
chief, sings, "Thou hast put gladness in my
heart, more than in the time that their corn and
wine increased." And how tranquilly the psalm
closes, and seems to lull itself to rest, "In peace
I will at once lie down and sleep, for Thou, O
Jehovah, only makest me dwell safely." The
growing security which experience of God's care
should ever bring, is beautifully marked by the
variation on the similar phrase in the previous
psalm. There he gratefully recorded that he
had laid himself down and slept; here he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg&nbsp;250]</a></span>
promises himself that he will lie down "in
peace;" and not only so, but that at once on
his lying down he will sleep&mdash;kept awake by
no anxieties, by no bitter thoughts, but, homeless
and in danger as he is, will close his eyes,
like a tired child, without a care or a fear, and
forthwith sleep, with the pressure and the protection
of his Father's arm about him.</p>

<p>This psalm sounds again the glad trustful
strain which has slumbered in his harp-strings
ever since the happy old days of his early trials,
and is re-awakened as the rude blast of calamity
sweeps through them once more.</p>

<p>The sixty-third psalm is by the superscription
referred to the time when David was "in the
wilderness of Judah," which has led many
readers to think of his long stay there during
Saul's persecution. But the psalm certainly
belongs to the period of his reign, as is obvious
from its words, "<i>The king</i> shall rejoice in God."
It must therefore belong to his brief sojourn in
the same wilderness on his flight to Mahanaim,
when, as we read in 2 Sam., "The people were
weary and hungry and thirsty in the wilderness."
There is a beautiful progress of thought
in it, which is very obvious if we notice the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg&nbsp;251]</a></span>
triple occurrence of the words "my soul," and
their various connections&mdash;"my soul thirsteth,"
"my soul is satisfied," "my soul followeth hard
after Thee;" or, in other words, the psalm is a
transcript of the passage of a believing soul
from longing through fruition to firm trust,
in which it is sustained by the right hand of
God.</p>

<p>The first of these emotions, which is so
natural to the fugitive in his sorrows, is expressed
with singular poetic beauty in language
borrowed from the ashen grey monotony of the
waterless land in which he was. One of our
most accurate and least imaginative travellers
describes it thus: "There were no signs of
vegetation, with the exception of a few reeds
and rushes, and here and there a tamarisk."
This lonely land, cracked with drought, as if
gaping with chapped lips for the rain that comes
not, is the image of his painful yearning for
the Fountain of living waters. As his men
plodded along over the burning marl, fainting
for thirst and finding nothing in the dry
torrent beds, so he longed for the refreshment
of that gracious presence. Then he remembers
how in happier days he had had the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg&nbsp;252]</a></span>
desires, and they had been satisfied in the
tabernacle. Probably the words should read,
"Thus in the sanctuary have I gazed upon
Thee, to see Thy power and Thy glory." In the
desert and in the sanctuary his longing had
been the same, but then he had been able to
behold the symbol which bore the name, "the
glory,"&mdash;and now he wanders far from it. How
beautifully this regretful sense of absence from
and pining after the ark is illustrated by those
inimitably pathetic words of the fugitive's
answer to the priests who desired to share his
exile. "And the king said unto Zadok, Carry
back the ark of God into the city. If I find
favour in the eyes of the Lord, He will bring
me again, and show me both it and His habitation."</p>

<p>The fulfilment is cotemporaneous with the
desire. The swiftness of the answer is beautifully
indicated in the quick turn with which the
psalm passes from plaintive longing to exuberant
rapture of fruition. In the one breath
"my soul thirsteth;" in the next, "my soul is
satisfied"&mdash;as when in tropical lands the rain
comes, and in a day or two what had been
baked earth is rich meadow, and the dry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg&nbsp;253]</a></span>
torrent-beds, where the white stones glistered
in the sunshine, foam with rushing waters and
are edged with budding willows. The fulness
of satisfaction when God fills the soul is vividly
expressed in the familiar image of the feast
of "marrow and fatness," on which he banquets
even while hungry in the desert. The
abundant delights of fellowship with God make
him insensible to external privations, are drink
for him thirsty, food for his hunger, a home in
his wanderings, a source of joy and music in
the midst of much that is depressing: "My
mouth shall praise Thee with joyful lips." The
little camp had to keep keen look-out for
nightly attacks; and it is a slight link of connection,
very natural under the circumstances,
between the psalms of this period, that they all
have some references to the perilous hours of
darkness. We have found him laying himself
down to sleep in peace; here he wakes, not to
guard from hostile surprises, but in the silence
there below the stars to think of God and feel
again the fulness of His all-sufficiency. Happy
thoughts, not fears, hold his eyes waking. "I
remember Thee upon my bed."</p>

<p>The fruition heartens for renewed exercise of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg&nbsp;254]</a></span>
confidence, in which David feels himself upheld
by God, and foresees his enemies' defeat and
his own triumph. "My soul cleaveth after
Thee"&mdash;a remarkable phrase, in which the two
metaphors of tenacious adherence and eager
following are mingled to express the two
"phases of faith," which are really one&mdash;of
union with and quest after God, the possession
which pursues, the pursuit which possesses Him
who is at once grasped and felt after by the
finite creature whose straitest narrowness is not
too narrow to be blessed by some indwelling of
God, but whose widest expansion of capacity
and desire can but contain a fragment of His
fulness. From such elevation of high communion
he looks down and onward into the dim
future, his enemies sunken, like Korah and his
rebels, into the gaping earth, or scattered in
fight, and the jackals that were snuffing hungrily
about his camp in the wilderness gorging themselves
on corpses, while he himself, once more
"king," shall rejoice in God, and with his faithful
companions, whose lips and hearts were true
to God and His anointed, shall glory in the
deliverance that by the arbitrament of victory
has flung back the slanders of the rebels in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg&nbsp;255]</a></span>
their teeth, and choked them with their own
lies.</p>

<p>Our space forbids more than a brief reference
to psalm lxii., which seems also to belong to
this time. It has several points of contact
with those already considered, <i>e.g.</i>, the phrase,
"sons of men," in the sense of "nobles" (ver.
9); "my soul," as equivalent to "myself," and
yet as a kind of quasi-separate personality
which he can study and exhort; the significant
use of the term "people," and the double exhortations
to his own devout followers and to
the arrogant enemy. The whole tone is that of
patient resignation, which we have found characterising
David now. The first words are the
key-note of the whole, "Truly unto God my
soul is silence"&mdash;is all one great stillness of
submissive waiting upon Him. It was in the
very crisis of his fate, in the suspense of the
uncertain issue of the rebellion, that these
words, the very sound of which has calmed
many a heart since, welled to his lips. The expression
of unwavering faith and unbroken
peace is much heightened by the frequent recurrence
of the word which is variously translated
"truly," "surely," and "only." It carries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg&nbsp;256]</a></span>
the force of confident affirmation, like the
"verily" of the New Testament, and is here
most significantly prefixed to the assertions of
his patient resignation (ver. 1); of God's defence
(ver. 2); of the enemies' whispered counsels
(ver. 4); to his exhortation of his soul to the
resignation which it already exercises (ver. 5);
and to the triumphant reiteration of God's all-sufficient
protection. How beautifully, too, does
that reiteration&mdash;almost verbal repetition&mdash;of
the opening words strengthen the impression of
his habitual trust. His soul in its silence murmurs
to itself, as it were, the blessed thoughts
over and over again. Their echoes haunt his
spirit "lingering and wandering on, as loth to
die;" and if for a moment the vision of his
enemies disturbs their flow, one indignant question
flung at them suffices, "How long will ye
rush upon a man? (how long) will ye all of you
thrust him down as (if he were) a bowing wall,
a tottering fence?" and with a rapid glance at
their plots and bitter words, he comes back
again to his calm gaze on God. Lovingly he
accumulates happy names for Him, which, in
their imagery, as well as in their repetition,
remind us of the former songs of the fugitive.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg&nbsp;257]</a></span>
"My rock," in whom I hide; "He is my salvation,"
which is even more than "from Him
cometh my salvation;" my "fortress," my
"glory," "the rock of my strength," "my refuge."
So many phases of his need and of God's sufficiency
thus gathered together, tell how familiar
to the thoughts and real to the experience of
the aged fugitive was his security in Jehovah.
The thirty years since last he had wandered
there have confirmed the faith of his earlier
songs; and though the ruddy locks of the young
chieftain are silvered with grey now, and sins
and sorrows have saddened him, yet he can
take up again with deeper meaning the tones
of his old praise, and let the experience of age
seal with its "verily" the hopes of youth. Exhortations
to his people to unite themselves
with him in his faith, and assurances that God
is a refuge for them too, with solemn warnings
to the rebels, close this psalm of glad submission.
It is remarkable for the absence of all petitions.
He needs nothing beyond what he has. As the
companion psalm says, his soul "is satisfied."
Communion with God has its moments of restful
blessedness, when desire is stilled, and expires
in peaceful fruition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg&nbsp;258]</a></span></p>

<p>The other psalms of this period must be left unnoticed.
The same general tone pervades them
all. In many particulars they closely resemble
those of the Sauline period. But the resemblance
fails very significantly at one point. The
emphatic assertion of his innocence is gone for
ever. Pardoned indeed he is, cleansed, conscious
of God's favour, and able to rejoice in it;
but carrying to the end the remembrance of his
sore fall, and feeling it all the more penitently,
the more he is sure of God's forgiveness. Let
us remember that there are sins which, once
done, leave their traces on memory and conscience,
painting indelible forms on the walls of
our "chambers of imagery," and transmitting
results which remission and sanctifying do not,
on earth at least, wholly obliterate. Let David's
youthful prayer be ours, "Keep back Thy servant
from presumptuous sins: then shall I be
upright, and I shall be innocent from much
transgression."</p>

<p>It does not fall within the scope of this volume
to deal with the suppression of Absalom's
revolt, nor with the ten years of rule that remained
to David after his restoration. The
psalter does not appear to contain psalms which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg&nbsp;259]</a></span>
throw light upon the somewhat clouded closing
years of his reign. One psalm, indeed, there is
attributed to him, which is, at any rate, the
work of an old man&mdash;a sweet song into which
mellow wisdom has condensed its final lessons&mdash;and
a snatch of it may stand instead of any
summing-up of the life by us:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 8em;">"Trust in the Lord, and do good;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.25em;">Dwell in the land, and enjoy security;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.25em;">Delight thyself also in the Lord,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.25em;">And He shall give thee the desires of thy heart.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.25em;">Commit thy way unto the Lord.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.25em;">Rest in the Lord and wait patiently for Him.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.25em;">I have been young and now am old,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.25em;">Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.25em;">I have seen the wicked in great power,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.25em;">And spreading himself like a green tree....</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.25em;">Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not."</span></p>

<p>May we not apply the next words to the
psalmist himself, and hear him calling us to
look on him as he lies on his dying bed&mdash;disturbed
though it were by ignoble intrigues of
hungry heirs&mdash;after so many storms nearing the
port; after so many vicissitudes, close to the
unchanging home; after so many struggles,
resting quietly on the breast of God: "Mark
the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg&nbsp;260]</a></span>
end of that man is peace?" Into this opal
calmness, as of the liquid light of sunset, all the
flaming splendours of the hot day have melted.
The music of his songs die away into "peace;"
as when some master holds our ears captive
with tones so faint that we scarce can tell sound
from silence, until the jar of common noises,
which that low sweetness had deadened, rushes
in.</p>

<p>One strain of a higher mood is preserved for
us in the historical books that prophesy of the
true King, whom his own failures and sins, no
less than his consecration and victories, had
taught him to expect. The dying eyes see on
the horizon of the far-off future the form of
Him who is to be a just and perfect ruler; before
the brightness of whose presence, and the refreshing
of whose influence, verdure and beauty
shall clothe the world. As the shades gather,
that radiant glory to come brightens. He
departs in peace, having seen the salvation from
afar. It was fitting that this fullest of his
prophecies should be the last of his strains, as
if the rapture which thrilled the trembling
strings had snapped them in twain.</p>

<p>And then, for earth, the richest voice which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg&nbsp;261]</a></span>
God ever tuned for His praise was hushed, and
the harp of Jesse's son hangs untouched above
his grave. But for him death was God's last,
best answer to his prayer, "O Lord, open Thou
my lips;" and as that cold but most loving
hand unclothes him from the weakness of flesh,
and leads him in among the choirs of heaven,
we can almost hear again his former thanksgiving
breaking from his immortal lips, "Thou
hast put a new song into my mouth," whose
melodies, unsaddened by plaintive minors
of penitence and pain, are yet nobler and
sweeter than the psalms which he sang here,
and left to be the solace and treasure of all
generations!<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The work of a brilliant and effective teacher. He writes with real power
and insight."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>"Dr. Maclaren has evidently mastered his subject with the aid of the best
authorities, and has put the results of his studies before his readers in a most
attractive form, and if we add that this commentary really helps to the better
understanding of the Psalms, that, far from degrading, it vivifies and illuminates
these sublime stories, and that it is written in a charming style, very
seldom falling below the dignity of the subject, we believe we only give it the
praise which is its due."&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>"It is scholarly, honest, thoughtful, and suggestive."&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>"Striking thoughts, strongly expressed, are to be found on every page."&mdash;<i>Manchester
Guardian.</i></p>

<p>"There is certainly room for the work which Dr. Maclaren does here&mdash;largely
because it is he who does it. The book is most heartily to be commended.
Preachers will find it to be a mine of wealth, and to Christians of
all kinds it may serve as a manual of devotion."&mdash;<i>Christian World.</i></p>

<p>"Dr. Maclaren's charming pages furnish a most fruitful field of study,
alike for those whose chief aim is personal edification, and for those who are
in quest of suggestions in the line of ministerial service. Altogether a most
valuable book."&mdash;<i>United Presbyterian Magazine.</i></p>

<p>"Most heartily do we welcome this new volume of Dr. Maclaren's
'Exposition of the Psalms.' It fully sustains the traditions of insight,
scholarly instinct, and spiritual force which gather around that beloved name.
Notwithstanding the rich treasures of devout literature which the Psalter has
called forth, there is a special niche for this book, and it makes a distinct
advance in tone and method upon all other commentaries on the Psalms.
We greatly err if this does not prove the most popular and useful commentary
in the English language, both among preachers and the commonality of
Christ's Church."&mdash;<i>Evangelical Magazine.</i><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"They are all written in clear, forcible language, and bring abundant
illustration from science, the facts of life and history and Scripture. All
through they manifest a true philosophical spirit, and a deep knowledge of
human nature. None can read them without profit."&mdash;<i>Leeds Mercury.</i></p></div>

<p class="center">THE GOSPEL OF ST. MARK.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As clear, luminous, and pellucid as is everything that comes from the pen
of the great Manchester preacher. Even in treating the simplest incident he
surprises his readers, and that without once forcing the note, or seeking
sensationalism."&mdash;<i>Christian World.</i></p></div>

as they are able, and as interesting as they are instructive and edifying.
Every paragraph is luminous with vivid expression."&mdash;<i>The London Quarterly
Review.</i></p></div>

<p class="center">THE GOSPEL OF ST. JOHN.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There is much freshness and suggestiveness in these papers. Dr.
Maclaren has studied the art of compression with great success, and no
teacher of a class could desire anything better for his purpose than these
lessons. They may be heartily recommended to all teachers as about the
best things of the kind to be had."&mdash;<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The more this volume is read and studied the more do we admire the
humility that ranks such a book as for Bible Classes only. It is for them
beyond all question, and better fare has nowhere been provided for them.
Whether they be Bible Classes or preachers who study this volume they will
be enriched and strengthened by it."&mdash;<i>Presbyterian.</i><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p></div>
